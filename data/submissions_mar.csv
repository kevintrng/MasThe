121,GME is about to breakout and I think this is why,mgkwis,"Hello Apes and hedgies, this is my first attempt at a TA and i will be utilizing technical indicators. 

So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

Edit: The yellow line is the MACD line and the red line is the signal line. When the MACD line crosses it upwards the momentum is up meaning price increase. Obviously vice versa on a downward cross.",1617153131.0

148,Hertz could become the next GME because of all the Melvins shorting it,mgij08,"Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.

Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.

# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short

Anybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)

13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.

https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a

A lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.

# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand

For most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.

&#x200B;

Gamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.

Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:

1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.
2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.

So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.

# This is not an investment

The stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you.",1617146792.0

398,National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging,mfxfuo,"This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

425,What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 means,mfvovp,"MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

474,Transocean's Hedge Fund Historical Manipulation and What is in Progress,mfsgf7,"A couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.

**The Hedge Fund Play:**

In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.

Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.

To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres & Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.

I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.

Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.

Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.

In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

[RIG](https://preview.redd.it/eghbkjl3nzp61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84565866abc86314337836e1206d4000161a934)

**Industry and Company Background:**

Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to Covid-19 lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand.

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year.

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.

With the up-trending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year.

Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil.

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.

From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets.

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.

**Recently - New Play:**

A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analyzing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.

My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Some legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.

The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.

This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.

The key here is that you believe BB will be going up in the next 6 months. If you don't think that and don't buy the other posted DD's then don't bother with my strategy.

My theory is that the stock will be back over 10$ a share in the next month or so. I'm willing to buy a 1000 shares at this price. Instead of just buying them for 9.6 this morning, I sold 10 CSP (Cash Secured Puts) for $950 that expire on 4/1. This means if the stock is less than 10$ at market close Thursday, I'll be buying 1000 shares for 10k.

If I wanted to be really safe, that'd put my cost basis at $9.05 a share. But this is WSB and I want to play earnings so fuck that. I immediately used my $950 cash to buy some FD's. 19x 4/1 10C.

TLDR: Read above to get free BB lottery tickets.

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

There is some fundamental analysis that could be discussed but I wanted to see what people thought about these points or any points I am missing for either case.

&#x200B;

In the bullish case:

\- Sports equipment: More demand in the spring to summer as people gather together more.

\- Guns and Ammo (Not to be politically spicy): ammo is scarce and they keep selling out

\- Existing Rising Revenue

\- 48% short interest on the float (compared to 44.6% on float for GME) as of March 15th

\- Lol people love to spend stimulus on hobbies

&#x200B;

In the bearish case:

\- Recent shootings could spook current investors with low sales after potential gun reform

\- Other online or retail competitors

\- Low volume can create massive price swings; may not have attention for a long time

\- Sports and leisure may not be priority with unemployment and inflation

&#x200B;

I am relatively new to everything but I want to hear outside opinions so as to not give any impression of confidence. I am not just looking for confirmation bias but for reasons why I would be wrong. I will see what other subreddits think too and compare responses. (Not a financial advisor)

&#x200B;

Sources: Yahoo Finance

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO/key-statistics?p=ASO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO/key-statistics?p=ASO)

Let me know if there are better sources I could look into.

&#x200B;

Edit:

This is a rather new account so I cannot comment on anyone yet. That is a fair point that short interest does not necessarily mean a bullish case. I am not anticipating a squeeze but at some point shorts do have to cover even for their profit. I am also realizing that saying to take advantage of the gun craze after a tragedy is pretty bad. It would be also bad to not mention an important factor in price. Thank you.",1616983391.0

- Not trying to draw attention away from GME right before take off. Pos: 200 @ $80 avg 🚀🚀 and 💎✋
- I realize that not every play or high short interest is a squeeze...

But serious question:

- Biden will be proposing an infrastructure plan next Wednesday, March 31 and there seems to be speculation that a significant portion of the 3 to 4 trillion dollar plan will be devoted to clean energy initiatives, including the electrical grid, charging stations etc. I realize this could take months if not longer to pass and the final results could be quite different but could this create some potential for companies like BLNK?

- BLNK exhibits conditions that are similar to GME in the sense that short interest is quite high (Short % of Float is 37.99% as of March 15) and the float is relatively low 30.87 M. Again, I realize it is not the same situation as GME as there may be other variables at play but just curious as to  any opinions and thoughts on this?

No positions yet.

Thank you all.",1616972082.0

961,SHORT COVERING 3/17 - $GME $AMC $RKT $BB $NOK,m74p9p,"**Short Interest report from S3 Partners update for March 17th**  
Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.

&#x200B;

**$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.

[$AMC, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING - Price goes UP](https://preview.redd.it/8cxvnms99mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b117cb869ad073ba1fdb3cc922b70461959c46d3)

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

[$GME, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING](https://preview.redd.it/fohleedr9mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=008c2d653462aa98f9c4ae3f4d897595a196df77)

&#x200B;

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

&#x200B;

**$BB a constant battle between the shorts shorting and covering! Looks like they are losing though!**

**$NOK absolutely no short covering or anything notable! This stock is SO BORING but I LOVE IT!**

[$NOK](https://preview.redd.it/vmmkko4lamn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f77383aa4a83bfd4c60cc9e5c1ef75e539d50e)

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**  
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**

We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!  


**EDIT: 4PM Aftermarket**  
Jowell and Fed Reserve today told us they will continue to support the economy, inflation is UNDER CONTROL, bonds chilled out. Recovery looks promising and we're on the right track. Markets re-bounded strong!  


**GME is COMPLETELY PRICE PINNED at $209! Trading sideways. These guys have it under complete control!**  


$BB closed up 1.22% and is flaky after-market  


$AMC closed 3.84% and is rising 3% after market! Go AMC!  


$NOK closed .9% and is up a bit after-market!  


$RKT is COMPLETELY CONTROLLED! They have this price pinned at EXACTLY $24.50. I've never seen anything like it. Complete manipulation.

**12:31 Update**

My posts keep getting removed from the megathread so I've created a post to see if that stays up. If this doesn't work, I'll stay where I was at. Send me a message if you see this disappear.

Thank you all for your help! I didn't leave WSB on purpose, automod just doesn't like me.

Current price: 223.61

**12:26 Update**

GME did break 220 again and has been hanging around 222. We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at.

Current price: 224.04

**11:31 Update**

Thank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing.

I'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors.

GME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving?

Current price: 218.85

**11:08 Update**

Two small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now.

Current price: 215.96

**10:40 Update** 

Another attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket.

Current price: 214.00

**10:16 Update**

We're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub.

The attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory.

Current price: 220.96

**10:08 Update**

This isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in 🤷.

They could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer.

I'll look closer and keep y'all updated.

Current price: 220.00

**10:03 Update**

GME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite.

Current price: 219.14

**9:41 Update**

After a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum. If GME can hit a Gamma Squeeze threshold, today could be insane.

Where's that threshold? I'm sure there are some wrinkle brains here that can figure that out for me. If y'all can give me the proof, I'll post it here.

Current price: 224.47

**9:25 Update**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Premarket

This might mean a really strong start for GME. Buckle up!

Current price: 220.12

**8:38 Update** 

WSB auto mod hates me. My post there got removed again, so it looks like I'm hanging out here again today. I'm working on a solution over there and will let you know if I migrate there.

I'm sorry I don't have candles or cups for you all. I know the standards here are pretty high, but I'm a smooth brained ape. I just hope that my removal from WSB doesn't cause undue panic.

GME is officially green in pre-market. Let's see if this continues into opening bell.

Current price: 214.00


**8:20 Update**

I'm making my own post in case this post gets removed in the WSB Megathread. If I can't make things work at WSB, I'll stay here again today.

Premarket, GME has stayed steady. I don't see the type of attacks we saw yesterday premarket. That doesn't mean that things won't light up once markets open. 

Current Price: 203.01

**8:03 Update**

It seems that my posts are still getting auto-deleted. I've removed all links. Please let me know if this posts gets removed again. I'm trying to figure out a solution before the GME Megathread comes online.

Current Price: 204.12

**7:42 Update**

New format! This will hopefully be easier to follow. If you want to know where I've been the past 2 days, read below! Updates will now be at the top of the post. I will transition this post to the GME Megathread when it comes up.

Premarket shows a slight dip from close yesterday. This doesn't seem to be the same sort of attack at premarket yesterday, but it's still early. 

Shorts Available: 400,000

Current Price: 201.00

**Corno4825, what happened? Why weren't you on WSB?**

I thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.

**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**

My fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.

When I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.

I am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.

**Corno4825, what did you learn?**

SHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.

That was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.

There are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.

**Corno4825, what does this mean?**

* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.
* The SHITs are running out of ammo.
* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.
* Earnings report is coming next week.
* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.
* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?",1616027610.0

993,"Do we have ANY info, or is there ANY outcome, that is not favorable for us? [GME]",m73w2c,"Hello there, fellow apes.

I'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. 

I've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.

For example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:

[https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)

What bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.

Is it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. 

As far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.

I mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.

And no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)

TL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.",1616026230.0

**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. 

Summary: 

1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. 
2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. 
3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. 
4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. 
5. The ""Minimum Exposure Point"" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",1616017203.0

1139,UWMC Addendum Update,m6zdqu,"UWMC Ultimatum Update

Hello apes. Before calling me a Cramer cronie or a shill bot - I am in on GME. I like the stock and will not sell until it reaches at least $42069. Obligatory 🚀🚀

Now to the meat: 

Detroit news published an article advising that UWMC ‘missed 80% of their brokers’. Meaning that by the addendum ultimatum on 3/15 they did not reach their target. Nevertheless, here is a breakdown as per the source about how many brokers are on board/declined/have yet to respond.

“The 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.”

And:

“Not responding doesn’t mean they didn’t commit — we’re still in communication with those who haven’t accepted or some clients are out of town, and it would be a vastly poor assumption to think that all those who have yet to accept won’t accept,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""

Source: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/03/16/united-wholesale-mortgage-misses-broker-goal-feud-rocket-mortgage-fairway-independent/4715422001/


TL;DR: 65% of independent brokers are confirmed with signing the deal. 1200 have yet to decide but CEO believe more than 50% will (seems reasonable).

Position: 83 shares @ 8.89av (new to the game, don’t @ me).

Edit: not sure how 1200 have still to make up their mind but a 3/15 addendum date was set. Nevertheless, I’m bullish on UWMC 🚀",1616013222.0

The FINRA GME SHORT INTEREST report has been issued on MAR-9-2021. The settlement date of the report is FEB-26-2021 and does not include the short selling volume to date of FEB-26-2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny37epynpkn61.jpg?width=1576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f8db19dffcc1a7c495f4c5c3252f675eadfa8b

Here we can use the mathematical calculation to calculate the SI of GME.

The FINRA SI of GME is 52.04% by the end of FEB-26-2021.(THIS DATA IS REPORTED BY THE HFs THEMSELVES, THEY WILL SURELY CHEAT AND WILL ONLY BE FINED FOR THAT)

1. The FINRA report is as follows:
2. [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0)

The FINRA report is updated every semimonthly, and the updated data are summarized by FINRA and published in the following 8-9 days.

[http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

2. Here comes the calculation

The latest FINRA report shows that the top 10 institutions hold 140.70 M, TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP accounting for about 201.73% of the total equity of GME. (LOOK!!! THERE ARE MORE THAN 10 INSTITUTIONS!!! EVEN MAYBE 100 OR 1000)

The GME held by the top 10 funds is about 23.35M, TOTAL FUND HOLDING accounting for 33.48% of the total equity of GME. (AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)

As suggested by [desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/), RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.

The total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)

(140.70 M-26.21M) + (23.35M-9M) = 128.24 M

GME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;

GME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;

Q: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?

Synthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.

The total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:

128.24M – 70 M = 58.24 M

The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:

Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float share \* 100%

Bring in data:

Float Short Interest = 58.24 M / 47M \* 100% = 123.91%

This means that at least 1.2 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO POINT OUT ANY MISTAKES THAT I MADE, I AM WILLING TO MAKE ANY EDIT.

EDIT 1: ([desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/))

RC Ventures is Ryan Cohen, new board member and is an insider. Shouldn’t be counted as institution. Possible double count, as the other board members don’t own that much. Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.

EDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https://www.reddit.com/user/dontkillchris/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating. The other stocks like AM-C don't have such problems.

EDIT 3: I found I can't reply to all of your comments, so I can only edit my post here. Is it because my account is quite new and has certain restriction?

EDIT 4:([bakebakingbaked](https://www.reddit.com/user/bakebakingbaked/)) But also doesn’t take ETFs into consideration-------Yes, maybe not included, so I say it's at least 180% !

EDIT 5:([AlexCormier1144](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexCormier1144/))Hey Zach. Thanks for the DD. Where did you get the 40 M from? How accurate is that number? Depending how accurate it is it could swing the SI by a good margin. Cheers!--------The 40M data is what I got by chance here in Reddit, look at the figure that shows the reddit website, but I lost track of the original post.

EDIT 6: I am in ASIA now, so due to the time difference I will not be able to reply you in time. My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!

EDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as ""shorting"".

EDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomadic8893/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!

EDIT 9：My account has been ban for commenting (Weired)! Will create another new account TMR!

EDIT10：Position figure removed.

EDIT11: IN ORDER TO DELETE THE REPEATED COUNTED SHARES, I WILL ONLY USE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDS DATA FOR CALCULATION. AGAIN, THIS ONLY PROVIDES A THOUGHT FOR CALCULATION, THE FINAL SI IS SO DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT12: I CAN'T CHANGE THE TITLE, IF POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT AS ""180% SHORT VOLUME"" WHICH IS STILL GOD DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT 13: THIS ACCOUNT CAN NO LONGER REPLY THE COMMENTS, FIND ME @[u/ZACK0806cool](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZACK0806cool/) THIS ACCOUNT WILL MAKE FURTHER EDITS AND I WILL TRY TO POST THIS REFINED VERSION THROUGH THAT NEW ACCOUNT!

1275,MARCH 17th DD Gme/Amc,m6sgzd,"This is not financial advise. 
Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it.
This was done at 11Am, March 16th.

TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI. 

GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday. 

My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19. 

What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK. 
You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone. Whoever the good hedge is, or the whale, who is fighting for us, will act at some point, and it will be obvious to anyone watching MACD and order books.

Hello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the ""case study"" below.

I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.

I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.

Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. 

Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...

1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company’s competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company’s new motto: “**The Platform for Amazing Things**.”
2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""

Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.

Am I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?  Good or bad, let me hear it.",1615985040.0

1281,"As fun and exciting it has been watching this fiasco unfold so far, it’s also equally frightening and a shame.",m6s5oa,"Although I’ve only got 6 shares in this GME roller coaster ride, I still consider myself an ape on the sidelines in this whole fiasco. It’s been such a crazy last couple of months and I honestly haven’t had this much (internet) excitement in my life. 

This is the very first and only stock that I’ve ever purchased and although I don’t know shit about stocks (I understand the concept but that’s it), this is something I’ll never forget. I’m happy for everyone who’s lives have changed for the better and it’s heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity. 

But I’m gonna be a negative Nancy ape for a bit. You guys saw it. You guys are seeing it. We’re all watching it live. How manipulative media outlets are. How quick they are at shooting their arrows. How our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they “questioned” that Bosnian whatever the fuck from Robindahood. They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. 

They tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attacking day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it’s because of the good intent in this sub that helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. 

I mean, I know the cliche of “never trust the news,etc” but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can’t see it by now you’re obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they’ll just change up the rules to punish the “little guys”. It really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor. 

You honestly couldn’t write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls. A fucking store that buys and sells used video games. A dude that seems like he’d make Keanu Reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit exposed them; but not because he wanted to fuck them over, but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol. 

It’s perfect.

This experience will be a valuable tool for everyone who has been a part of this for the rest of their lives.

Reposting to WSB because, well honestly, you give better feedback than GME sub.

I am new to investing, but I am trying to determine my own ""fair market value"" for one share of GME, assuming after the squeeze gets squoze, and **after** all the short-interest and dust settles, where would a company, such as GameStop, likely trade at based on a mildly optimistic **future outlook** (3-5 years)?

Just remember the vision that R.C. has discussed in writings to GameStop, and the future strategic goals he hopes to achieve.

&#x200B;

I think the safest **industry(s)** we can assume, given the ""digital-first"" strategy would be:

\- E-Commerce (Online Retail) 125B Avg Mkt Cap, PE 129.05, Exp growth **20.17%**

\- Retail (Distributor) 27B PE 21.91, Exp growth **10%**

\- Software (Entertainment), 44b,  PE 109.44, Exp growth **19.72%**

\- Gaming Industry 47B, PE  27, Exp growth **12%**

&#x200B;

**Similar Industry/Potential Competition:**

Best Buy (28.6B / 16 PE),

Target (89.5B / 21 PE),

Amazon (1.54T / 74 PE),

Netflix (226B / 85 PE),

Steam/Valve (62.46B),

Overstock(?), Walmart(?)

&#x200B;

**Pros**

\+ E-commerce retail, expanding reach in current markets (US/CA/AUS/EU)

\+ Consolidate physical stores, Free Up Cash for next cycle.

\+ In-Store Entertainment (VR / Lan / Tournament hosting etc)

\+ Multi-Channel Distribution (Gaming PCs, Video Games, Streaming (P))

\+ Brand Awareness / Expanded (free!) publicity

\+ 60m+ Power-Up Reward subscription service

\+ Same-day delivery of Video Games/PC Hardware from existing locations ^((credit both)

[^(SomeGuyNamedPaul)](https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeGuyNamedPaul/) ^(/) [^(Iam\_nameless)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iam_nameless/) ^(from previous post))

\+ (Possible) Streaming Service

\+ (Possible) In-Store Entertainment, Kids and Adults

\+ (Possible) P2P Marketplace??

\+ (Possible) Capture microtransaction market

\+ (Possible) Esports brand/ Streaming

\+ (Possible) Ad revenue on their streaming service etc. (\~30B gaming ad rev)

\+ (Possible) On-Demand Gaming platform

&#x200B;

**Cons**

\- Past performance

\- Lower demand for physical games (\~15-17%)

\-  About 80% of total Video Games revenue (200B) came from F2P Microtransactions in 2018

What's the worst that can happen right?

I just want to know what a share of GME should be worth, using a future-looking fundamental approach to an evolving/pivoting business, and what the ""generally expected"" price would be if everything goes ""according to plan"" (given 80-90% success probably, for instance).

&#x200B;

**Anything you guys wanna add/remove** let me know, I will soon add some Industry data and revenue projections as soon as I research and write it all down..

# Thanks to everyone providing their feedback so far.

# Looks like my next steps are to dig into competitor businesses for profit margin data, determine the financial impact the initial pivot strategies.

# The March 23 Earnings Call should hopefully provide an overview of the business strategy moving forward, and I should have more related financial/sector data ready at that time.

# Thanks to all💎🦍 and 🌈🐻 out there.... TO THE MOON!!!!!🚀

\*This is not financial advice, I started investing 4 months ago. I own GameStop stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Update\*\*

Anyways, if anyone's interested I figured the **most** **conservative value I would value Gamestop** would be **$291.85** (factors in the post-hype post-squeeze).

This predicates on my theory they can generate 1b net profit in the first 1-2 Years, given the unprecedented demand and I believe streaming will play a vital role, like Twitch.  Essentially I see them as the potential ""Amazon of Gaming"", having their hands across multiple sectors.

I predict they won't just ease into the market, they will DISRUPT it.

Other competitors playing around in the gaming industry won't be able to compete, there will be massive return from retail investors, whether they previously gamers or not.

&#x200B;

Opportunities:

\-**Hit the ground Running with strategic locations, (In-store Streamed Events??)**

\-H**yper-growth ecommerce shift**

\-**Gaming PCs in higher demand.**

\-C**apture microtransaction market by,**

\-Large audience shift to Gamestop brand **over** competitors, for same products.

\-Resurgence of audience demanding of new Gaming Content and Live INTERACTION!!

&#x200B;

So, **at least 1B annual revenue in next 1 to 2 yrs,**

and a, *very conservative*, **30 PE (based on related industry averages weighted by profit estimates by sector).**

...then I gave the whole ""successful rebrand"" thing an **82% chance** of happening (lol idk, take it or leave it).

So yeah, **$291.85**, super conservative, this would be my floor essentially.

# Realistically, I am calculating that it should naturally hover anywhere from $300-$500, (much potential, wide range)  assuming constant number of shares, ofc.

**So what does this mean for friday 03/19?**

Every GME stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies day and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on.

Every GME Stock price above 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters. So I guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday: to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$.

Every GME Stock price below 150 $ on 03/19 will end in... well... So many PUTS then in the money, this will end really bad for the stock price and shorters will make a lot of money to reload their shorting ammo.

&#x200B;

**\*\*TLDR:\*\***

GME above 300 $ on friday: Start to Valhalla from friday on.

GME above \~170$ on friday, Calls will still win, GME will rise more.

Anything below 150$ on friday: Here we go again, 40$ GME.

So it's very important this week that we and the long wales are able to keep the stock price >170$.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Regarding Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls:

The huge amounts of new 800c Calls last week didn't help us because it was way out of the money for the Marketmakers, so they didn't see a reason to cover those calls. Stock price was \~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money. So I really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this Friday, so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercised.If there's some Pro here who can clarify the MMs covering process I'd be grateful.",1615978669.0

First and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips. I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.

Have you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.

Think about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?

The little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair ""stock"" market and that anyone can become rich.

I'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.

The thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.

But seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?

Hint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING

No matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.

**Next my fellow retards,**

HDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.

No time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever 🙌🙌🙌

Remember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.

My blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.

I can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.

TO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO. GAMESTOP WILL BE THERE.

Elliot Wave Theory

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l0vdexj5ohn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=41320130f91b5347a393774aedaf563a91b461a1

Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064

Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf

Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb

Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January 

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec

What actually happened after that ""prediction""?

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

🚀 Pre-Launch

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",1615972576.0

1401,When there is max pain there is max profit.,m6nvqj,"I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here’s my update after today’s fuckery. 

Real quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that’s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I’m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best/expect the worst. This is why I’m hype, take it or leave it. I also don’t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.

First, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That’s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I’m sitting there getting pissed off because it’s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell’s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn’t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn’t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.

The whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It’s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It’s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. 

Here’s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we’re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don’t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That’s my hope. Today’s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won’t. 

If RKT can bounce back above 26 then we’re right back in the game. Again, there really weren’t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. 

If the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That’s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. 

Let’s finish the week off positively. We’re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it’s undervalued as shit.",1615970464.0

1404,Give me a chance please,m6nmto,"TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich

I know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. 

AMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. 

Hating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single ""retail investor"" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win/squeeze, the entire economy/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

 Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. 

To me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. 

So support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME.

1407,Can the MMs and HFs keep artificially increasing GME float (synthetic shares) to keep kicking the short-squeeze down the road?,m6njm8,"Not a financial or legal advisor.  Honest question.

I'm a pretty sophisticated ape.  Unless I am missing something, the only way for 106.46% of float to be held by Institutions and 21.88% of the float to be held by Insiders (data courtesy of Trade-Ideas) is if some of the shares held long are synthetic shares.  How is that even possible (rhetorical question)?  My understanding is synthetic shares are used to ensure liquidity in the options market; but the I.O.U's are supposed to be settled with actual shares if an option is exercised.  Rather than spend hours studying the regs, I will just assume either (1) the rules do not impose a sufficient amount of audit/reconciliation requirements; or (2) rules are being broken.

Either way, it seems the MMs and HFs have been able to ""create"" synthetic shares, which are then sold and purchased ""long"" in the market.  Apart from confirming how rigged and fucked up the system is; can't they just keep this game up forever?  In other words, can't they just purchase a bunch of in-the-money call options and exercise them to ""buy back"" the shares and return them to the lender? There is a theory that is what the hedgies tried to do last week in their short ladder attack (and that it was actually the Hedgies that had purchased the $300 and $325 call options; and, that it was the long whales who prevented the price from being $300 last Friday so the hedgies could not exercise their options as they are running out of shares held long).

BTW: I am bullish on GME and have a large position.  So certainly not to rain on anyone's parade.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* My karma is too low to respond to comments.  I get the data out there is different on what the % held by institutions actually is.  But the question remains that the amount of shares held long > the float.

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I am a big time technical trader.  The stock certainly is not behaving normally.  It is constantly being manipulated (hence the dive on extremely low volume pre-market this morning, which induced a minor panic sell).  The fact that so much manipulation is going on of the stock price tells me this story is far from over.

***Edit 3*** I understand how short selling works. I understand that brokers irresponsibly lend out the same share multiple times. But before we even get to what the ""true"" short float is, we have institutional+insider+retail who hold > 100% of the float. That alone should cause the infinity squeeze (even if the short float were only 20%). But they keep finding shares to short....if they are not ""real"" shares, what are they? And if the same share is lent to shorts multiple times, the same share is owned long by multiple people. Yet the MMs still sold thousands of call options last week (hundreds of which were in the money). How can options even be sold if there are no shares available?",1615969404.0

Elliot Wave Theory

[ Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below... ](https://preview.redd.it/idm32ufg5hn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=9998fee714a9de34c57496decc0b0084514bcfd6)

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

https://reddit.com/link/m6mkl8/video/vsm22l8l5hn61/player

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"". Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

#  So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https://preview.redd.it/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

[What actually happened after that \\""prediction\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

[🚀 Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

1444,RKT Catalyst coming at the right time before the Triple Witching 3/19.,m6lwvt,"**Hello friends,**

In the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.

Well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.

In the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.

Short Interest is up:

Todays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)

**Shorts still in the game:**

As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.

During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

So the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

[DTCC Rule](https://preview.redd.it/sy0i9annvgn61.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f92e73f2ada0b0483aef46f515cd3c8494ca5b7)

**Housing data comes out March 17th:**

This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.

1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.
2. Employment is strengthening.
3. Economy is re-bounding.
4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.
5. Low rates continue.

**Open Call Options:**

Look at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.

https://preview.redd.it/c6ldqdcvvgn61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31c64985c5fc5c45a3c236a93d36a1ec39ce603

**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**

Stimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.

Triple witching:

Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.

Triple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell—called the ""triple witching hour""—can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

The housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links.... GL lol but it shows we are MOONING and so is the Housing market.

What does this mean for ROCKET?! Well it indicates that Rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term. The current price is such a fire sale it isn't even comparable to what we will see in 5-10 years from now.

Inflation is about to take place and we may see 5-10% increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this.

This is Bullish for Rocket and thats why I will be holding Rocket Long term.

**TLDR:**

**RKT is going to Gamma squeeze if we break $29.00 and 3/19 triple witching will push the price past previous highs.**

**RKT is a great short term and long term play.**

**RKT catalysts, Stimulus, Open Calls, Housing Data March 17th, Short interest 35%, and Triple witching 3/19.**

1448,If you still have doubts about the infamous ”Naked Shortings” or ”how can a stock have more shares than 100% of the outstanding float?” let me clear that out,m6ls2r,"**TR;LD:** Institutions uses Alternative Trading (ATs) mechanism called Traderbots (HFT, high -frequency trading algos) to insert large positions in the markets using dark pools (hidden positions). Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows ”naked shorting” by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional ”naked shorting” when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. 



**How does this happen?**


Alternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. 

The reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. 

At first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of ”block transactions” around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as ”*toxic*” market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of “block transactions,” where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.

There is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.

_**Here is Barclay’s disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:

“*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, “[n]one of which*,” recalled one Director, “*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*” Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.

*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*


_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_

a) front-runs transactions, 

b)  void regulation, 

c)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), 

d) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, 

e) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),

f) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.

*Does that sounds familiar???*

A lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and ”times and sales” charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.

The author of the paper went a step forward saying that ”ATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.”

The idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. 

**How is this becomes illegal?**

”If dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.”

When a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it’s intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. ”naked shorting” sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator’s books (not sent to NSCC/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It’s one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.

**Why is important to understand this?**


This process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every ”fail to deliver” the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.

If you having read it yet, [check this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)  from u/gafgarian

As long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market. It's a matter of who gets tired first.

Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don’t matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‘oh no I got caught’ fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I’ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let’s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock’s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel’s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let’s see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‘best execution’ for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn’t in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 – August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC’s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‘system issue’ which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I’m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‘oh X didn’t know, they’re not trained!’ as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 – August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 – February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it’ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn’t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

1514,$RKT shot down by shorts...,m6jh5g,"Team RKT reporting in. We were humming along this week quite nicely with all signs pointing to a strong gamma ramp that would push the price well beyond $30, cause massive buying and likely push even higher than last time. 

However, a hedge fund(Melvin, is that you?) or other big player with heavy puts or sold calls against RKT didn't want that to happen.

This afternoon there was a 400k share (~$10M) short bet. That likely trigged stop limits and de-hedging by market makers causing the price to drop even further. It was timed during low volume for maximum effect(wiping out the bid side). It was meant to control the price. There was also heavy put activity today holding it back(possibly by the same entity). Shorts are trying to take back control before the 03/19 expiry happens.

The 03/19 expiry has huge open interest, especially at the $28.89 level. If Rocket had continued the 3% daily from Monday, we'd have hit $28.99 on Friday(and likely sooner as the gamma ramp kicked in). This short bet today was pure manipulation. Timed for maximum effect to ensure RKT doesn't have time to recover before Friday.

The gamma squeeze is still possible, but not without heavy retail buy-in. If RKT breaks $27 for a sustained time period with the $25.89 and $26.89 open interest going in the money, breaking the $29 barrier that would kick-off a gamma squeeze becomes a real possibility.

I truly believe RKT is worth far more than it's trading at. I like this stock.

Position: Shares and about 150 calls at various strikes from $23.89 to $32.89 overall position size ~$10k after today's drop. Plan on another 150 shares with my stimulus.

Edit: Got Stimy today and 170 shares at a discount. Still holding my Calls.",1615957706.0

1543,Citadel Regulatory Breaches – Know thy enemy DD,m6iptw,"Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don’t matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‘oh no I got caught’ fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I’ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let’s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock’s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel’s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let’s see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‘best execution’ for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn’t in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 – August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC’s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‘system issue’ which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I’m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‘oh X didn’t know, they’re not trained!’ as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 – August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 – February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it’ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn’t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn’t give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

1551,THE MYTHICAL UNICORN AKA EXTREMELY ABNORMAL negative beta of GME evidence that shorts have NOT covered,m6if56," **TLDR** \- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

At 16 March 2021.

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).

The Biden Bucks Hedgie Fucker 1400 is a load of cash to be flung like poop at their favorite stocks.

This is also the last week of the old short rules.  So Hedgies need to make their money.  Others will ignore the perils of the new rules.  Some will cover out of self interest, some will cover out of fear, others won't cover and have to cover later this week.

Edit:

Okay this is what I think could happen seriously.  

&#x200B;

1.  All Apes charge GME with Biden Bucks/Stimmy Crumbs.  The market goes oh shit.  The minute a circuit breaker is thrown retailers will see the blood in the water and hold on to your butts.
2. Apes charge GME and AMC, some will hold others may take profits and go back and forth between GME and AMC.  The prices cycle higher as more share can be purchased.  Again retailers see blood in the water and join in.
3. Apes go in all directions.  The majority of which will be GME and AMC.  Other places will see upticks.  Share prices rise and that carries through Friday.  At which point Friday is the last safe day for shorts to get out without facing a ""sudden death"" cover your shit or else call under the new rules.  There will be funds that scoff at the new rules believing they can carry on as usual.  Hubris can be built into institutions and it can cause some big market makers to get caught under the new rules and face extinction because they are dinosaurs, we are Apes! ",1615954452.0

1596,Gme isn't over,m6hj9a,"Hello retards,

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a 🥖French🥐 retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other. In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng 🧻🙌). It also trigger stop loss (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE?

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data 🖍️ to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions.

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our 🌈🐻.

* ***🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸***

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people 💖) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge 🚀 tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win !

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose !

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet : “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.”

TLDR: Price down cause of short sells and 🧻🙌 ----> Solution = Buy now and hold 💎🙌 for going to 🚀🌑

I like the stock (16.56@216)

Put in what article info I could in case of a pay-wall-block

GameStop stock dropped again shortly after the market opened on Tuesday. While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.

Shares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock’s one-year low of $2.57.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron’s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.

Dusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.

“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky added.

The company’s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop’s parabolic ascent.
GameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit’s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.

I would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.",1615951059.0

Per his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.

So let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.  Thoughts?

There are many factors that can give fuel to this undervalued moon rocket  🚀  🚀  🚀 :

1. **Potential squeeze** (short term): this stocks has been shorted hard in the past month and now sits at 8,40$ (IPO price was about 10$ , so is basically for sale now ) , but there are many calls for 19/03/2021 at 9$/10$  that we can make expire ITM for an explosive effect ! (shitload of open insterest  also for april calls)
2. **RUSSEL Index inclusion** (short term and long term): UWMC is slated to join the RUSSEL 1k&3k indexes on March 21 = boom baby ! all the funds /etf / institutial players who replicate the index in some form HAVE to buy the stock.
3. **UWMC pasys dividends**  (long term)
4. **Analysts are bullish on this stocks**, giving an average target price of **11,63$ / 12,40$**  (in case if u care )
5. **The company had a superb 2020 (in terms of revenue / earnigs )** and is projected to have also a superb Q1 (house market & mortage are in ""bullish"" mode )
6. **the CEO is steel balls guy** ,read some article on the ""ultimatum"" he made to kill $RKT (SPOILER: i**t worked -** [**https://i.redd.it/54j1n92kmen61.png**](https://i.redd.it/54j1n92kmen61.png))

1713,AMC Apedate (Update),m6e8dk,"Welcome back Apes.

(upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!)
We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. 

**Fact 1:** Last Friday the GME &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.


**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that ❤️. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!

**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter’s market manipulation.

SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let’s start with the premarket update

**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. 

Stocks available to short: 650.000
Current Stock Price: 13.46$

**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.

Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)
Current Price: 13.35$

Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!

**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that’s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn’t far away until than.

**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,
I’m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn’t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain’t too late! 

Current Price: 13$
Shares available to borrow: 750.000

**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes 🚀). 
Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their “borrowable-shares” it’s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the 🚀 starts off to the 🌚 

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current stock price: 12.94$

**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won’t succeed.

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;— is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!

**Update 12:03**
1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that’s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. 
Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that 
Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.

Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.
Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)

**Update 12:08**
The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.

**Update 12:20**
HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they’re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i’m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.50$

**Update 12:21**
What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.

Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%
Current Price: 12.75

**Update 13:01**
AMC is slowly refuelling it’s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.
Besides that not much has happened.

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.8$

**Update 13:05**
It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!
We also have an inversed head &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. 

**Update 13:55**
We have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren’t planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! 
The next mark is around 13.6-14$. 
Anyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \*apes nodding their head\*
... and if not ill tell you ... \*apes breathe eases\*.
This means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won’t be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$.

Shorts available currently: 6.000.000
Price Currently: 13.15

**Update 14:18**
Still very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$.

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Current Price: 13.3$

**Update 14:30** 
Shitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some 🦍 Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. 

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Price: 13.02$

**Update: 14:52**
Apparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! 

Current Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg

**Update 14:57**
Quick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$
Did they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say.

**Update Hoodie** So i have been trying to guess some coupon codes on that shop below and it seems as they have made an *Easter egg** with the hidden code: **diamondhands**
It will give you an discount if you order something
Don’t believe me? Go and try it 🦍🚀

Warning: I hope my boss doesn’t ask me why i am taking regular shits every 1 hour ... 🚀

**And I’m making an giveaway for BUY THE FKN DIP!** ... APES since we are currently in a dip i will gift [this Hoodie](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie) to one comment  if AMC reaches 16$ EOD! Cause i fkin love the stonk and made allready double my initial investment back! 🚀🥵

1775,A Lurker's Appreciation Post - Retirement Account All In,m6cibd,"I've been watching and participating in this spectacle since late January. I haven't been posting. I lurk on Reddit. I don't post. I do read, however, despite having the comprehension of an ape. The content I've been consuming - the personal stories, the wrinkled-brain analysis, the memes - has been amazing. This truly is a unique community - it's global, inclusive, and (by and large) supportive. It's a great resource for those, like myself, who have jumped into the market with little understanding. GameStop piqued my interest. This community has helped refine that interest into understanding...well, maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of what's going on. So, as an ape who has been lurking and learning, I thank all you apes -- from Cornelius to Zaius, from Grodd to Solovar, and of course King Kong himself, DFV -- you apes run the spectrum, and are on the spectrum. You've helped me, the ape from 2001: A Space Odyssey (I think it's an ape, though maybe a neanderthal - apes can't remember details from films), gather my first investment tools. 

On a related note, I put my retirement account into GME. Pretty high cost basis? No. Not considering what's going to happen in the near future. It's gonna be bananas.

While the market is bullshit, and you should never hinge on timing or dates, it can serve as an indication for when to load the rocket. Especially if the crayons are confirmed by reality later on.

&#x200B;

***METHOD***

* For easier reading of trends, Heikin Ashi sticks are used. For ape who don't know, green = STONKS. red = NOT STONKS
* Prices in bubbles are from regular candles (probably), as HA-candles are bad at showing actual open-close prices.

&#x200B;

***BANANAS***

* Roughly 1 month trading cycle from the OPEN of first non-squeeze to beginning of next non-squeeze.
* The Big Shortening happens over exactly 2 trading weeks, from monday 1st week to friday on 2nd week.

&#x200B;

***CRAYON 1***

* Assuming the same percent increase OPEN-to-OPEN, the current Big Shortening should end on 2021-04-01 (that's 1/4 for retarded). This is a Thursday because Jesus doji on friday.
* The OPEN on 5/4 being the same % above previous, places us at roughly $110

[CRAYON 1 - 1d Chart](https://preview.redd.it/2y77pdshren61.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a706d684b8f2154d293150fa0a3db2c76cf0e64c)

***CRAYON 2***

* Assuming the same pullback as previous Big Shortening (-87%)
* The OPEN on 5/4 is somewhere around $37

[CRAYON 2 - 1d Chart](https://preview.redd.it/bw44f2quten61.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=c159fa6a4dab3e560d9337fa110c2f2d734c365e)

***CURRENT STATUS***

Going intraday and taking a snapshot as of me mashing this randomly on my typewriter, we can see the pattern being followed quite closely. Although not having the giant drop that previous wave had.

1797,Oil. Buy $GUSH,m6c0o8,"TLDR - Oil is going to boom.  Buy $GUSH

Apes.  Listen up.  The world is slowly emerging from this pandemic.  China is largely out of it.  America is coming out of it.  Everyone in America who wants a vaccination will be able to get one by this summer, maybe sooner.  Travel restrictions are going to be lifted.  You know what's going to happen?  People are going to lose their motherfucking minds and they are going to take all that unused vacation and $GME money and TRAVEL!  

The pandemic crushed oil.  $GUSH went from $1462 a share on Dec. 1, 2019 to $15.66 a share on March 1, 2020.  The world shut down.  Travel stopped.  No cruises, few flights, people cooped up in their houses.  The price crashed and the oil companies started closing wells and could not move product.  If you're like me, you filled up your car once in the March 20 - June 20 timeframe.

When the world fully emerges from this pandemic people are going to travel.  See family.  Just get away.  People are saving money, a lot of money.  People are saving vacation time, a lot vacation time.  People are going to fly, cruise, drive, all over the world and the oil companies are not going to ramp up production (on purpose) fast enough which will create supply issues while demand is sky high which will push the price sky high and the oil companies will use that to try and recoup losses they suffered during the pandemic before political pressure builds to the point where they have to increase production and get price down.  This will be especially true for places like Russia where their economy really depends on oil.  Obviously the OPEC countries in the Middle East too.

$GUSH is going to rocket with all that demand.  Does it get back to $1462 a share or higher?  Maybe.  However, what if it only gets back to $500 a share but you bought it today at $81.50 a share?  Still a pretty nice payday.  Only recovers to $250 a share?  Still doing good.  Buy $GUSH.

This is the same tribulation that happened last february where shills and bots swarmed WSB that also weeded out the paper hands and only the true diamond hands held and stayed. 
Not a financial advise...
 Buy the fucking dip and dont make the same mistake that i did when i didnt buy the $48 per share GME cuz i got afraid that i would lose more. WSB is not a place for people who gets scared when the board turns RED.
All of us who stayed here and Hodl for the last 3 months can say that this kind of scare tactic doesn't faze us anymore cuz we don't  give a flying fuck we simply thank for the sale and buy more.

 To the hedgies and their cronies reading this...SUCK MY DIAMOND GOLD GILDED DICK!! im not fucking selling. Do your worst and i wont care for i would be just busy watching Gordon Ramsey in Hell's Kitchen.

To the Apes..
 THIS IS WAR you fucking sons of bitches casualties are fucking expected and loses will be everywhere because this is a life and death situation the hedgies wont simply just roll over and give up. This aint disneyland where is all sunshine and rainbows, people enjoying and laughter in the background. Welcome to fucking hell where reds are green, green are green, and Mondays are the new Fridays. If you fucking cunts cant handle pressure you dont deserve to be here in WSB.

To the True Diamond Hand Comrades...
Its just simply a typical day in a typical week here in WSB lets grab a drink and food and play games on our consoles and let the paper hands panic and shills demoralize the paper hands. We know that they know that we know that they are really fucked and desperate for the MOASS is about to come. Lets just chill, sit back, and relax. We thank the hedgies for giving us a big sale on GME cant wiat for the next paycheck.

1913,3/16/2021 GME Open Interest Report,m6a6kw,"I'M AN IDIOT. THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

**TL:DR:** **The option shorts are pulling out all the stops to keep the price down because they are fucked on the options side of things at certain levels. After $300, it starts getting really bad really fast for them and it spirals out of control.** **(****Added per comment)**

\* \* \*

Here is today's Open Interest Report and Total Exposure for weeks with significant open interest as of market open and based on Friday's closing price of 220.14. (OI data is not real time; we only know OI after close).

Posting here for the first time. If you like it (and it doesn't get blocked), I'll continue posting here as well as my other board. For the background of this post and all of the weaknesses of this stupid analysis, scroll down to the end.

\* \* \*

For all open contracts at close of business yesterday and yesterday's closing price of 220.14, total exposure decreased to **$2.546 billion** down from $3.084 billion yesterday. 87% of that exposure is tied up in the options shown in the Figures and Tables expiring Friday ($925 million), 4/16 ($691 million), 7/16 ($306 million), and 1/21/22 ($288 million). *See* Figure 1 and Table 1.

In terms of actual shares needed to cover short options that are in the money, our hypothetical single actor will need to find **11.5 million** shares of GME (or their equivalents) to cover their positions across all open ITM positions. This is approximately 21% of the float of GME and 16% of all shares outstanding. *See* Figure 2 and Table 2. This is down from 14.8 million shares needed to cover yesterday.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",1615933365.0

2097,IMPORTANT WEEK: GME - MUST READ,m6603w,"Good morning my fellow retards. Please read this full post as this is highly important. Today is a very important week for us. Friday we closed on the lighter side and let a ton of open interest on call options expire. The good news is, we have about 1,700,000+ apes like ourselves clearing $1,400 between today and tomorrow who plan to join the cause. That's an additional 10MM in volume outside of what we are used to seeing. A lot of you retards slap the ask as well. Shorts will start to panic cover, and we will likely even see higher highs by the end of this week. It's more important than ever that we continue to hold. Do not get fucked by the asshole's mind games and fuck tactics. Take these fuckers down and show no mercy. You hold until we are at $1,000. And I am a retard but I have done plenty of obsessive DD on GME and let me tell you, $1,000 IS a realistic PT.

Any and all dips are a gift. 

I hope this discussion thread can help at least ONE person retire early. If it does, my work is complete.

Best of luck to all my fucktards and please hold that mother fucking boat.

Also comparing charts on Flowtrade. Looking at today we saw a down turn in the big banks in the morning to mid-day and a small recovery at end of day. This is a theory right now, but GME has significant shares held in Eee Tee Effs. In there the largest owners are you guessed it big banks. This may be correlation at best and not causation. I'd love for someone to poke holes in the data. It's still a work in progress and I update as often as I can. I've tried to gather as much applicable data about GME exposure as possible.

""I hope this is considered worthwhile to not ban me; please be kind WSB mods. I think this is a good talking point. ""

Buying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental

Someone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd ""crash"" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.

\-------------------------

I've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups. (These pickups have been the daily dips)

&#x200B;

Averaging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB ""strategy"" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.

GME and this short situation makes this one of those situations w*here every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket,* so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point **is my priority.**

I'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that & 1 share of GME on Robinhood back when it was 80 bucks. ( i know i know) Robinhood is bad, no doubt, BUT The wife is handling robin hood. Its  smaller stakes but she is doing a good job & to me rationalizes still using the platform until i can get her to fidelity

That's why the fidelity account became our trading platform for main investments, Robinhood for light (math based - non-centralized) ( to avoid the C word) investment and more long term holdings.  Also we have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.

Thank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation.

As a matter of disclosure {ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment (actually covers across all my trading platforms)} & THE REST IS FUEL FOR THE ROCKET TO MARS.

&#x200B;

I am diamond hand to the moon, but I want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 more full shares in the mean time so I don't have to touch my main shares.

TLDR: So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough. Don't be afraid of a reasonable change in your price per share if quantity is your main asperation

Avg per share was 75.55 for 9 ( buying fractionally it has increased to 81.56 for the gain of .39 shares)

They have done it. Something far more terrifying than any amount of Market manipulation or hate speech articles misrepresenting the sub. They have released their most powerful attack. The day I feared the most... the attack I assumed they where to sane to do, tendies will be ripped out from our mouths 

*I have seen entire companies reduced to nothing but soot and ash at the mere whisper of the word ""buy"" from Cramer.* 

*I've seen grand standing Goliath companies firm as pillars crumble down to rubble at a Cramer recommendation.* 

*I've seen the moon fall further faster and harder than Majoras Mask, all from a Cramer recommendation.  I have seen it. it is horrible, an absolute bloodbath.* 

Market caps halved, moons fallen, gains destroyed, land baron of trendies for miles across in any direction from where ever he was standing when he utters the deathly phrase from his accursed lips ""buy.""  
Lands once beautiful brimming with green life as far as the eye can see, with tendies growing from trees to pick at any whim- all replaced with a hellish red arrow 

The all to notorious Cramer recommendation. The final destination of a stock, the end of the line. It will not be a quick or painless death; this is the curse of strength that a stock as powerful as GME has to bear. GME will not go quickly or quietly in the night. It will not go peacefully. However the angel of death has already been released from the lips of the mad man and we do not have enough lambs blood to pacify it. 

Some of you may retreat, I will not judge you for that- seeing the stock go from 400 to 40 is one thing but... this... this horrific scene. It's too gut wrenching, a Cramer recommendation is far worse. 

Back in our darkest hour, when the sub was filled with nothing but thousands of shills... the only thing giving me hope was that Cramer was saying not to buy Gme. Even with nothing but the word sell being echo'd into my head at every turn Cramer saying not to buy was more than enough to buy and hold.  With the entire Financial system against us rigging itself at every turn, Cramer saying not to buy was enough to continue onward. 

This however... this is the death of hope.   


I chose to stand here and die on this diamond line with the rest of those to proud to leave,

Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking

*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.

**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:

1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.
2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.

**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.

In a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.

**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**

Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.

&#x200B;

[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https://preview.redd.it/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)

&#x200B;

*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*

***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***

Just taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**

Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.

**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.

**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.

**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.

The Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's

ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.

**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.

&#x200B;

[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https://preview.redd.it/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)

[ETF's being shorted in the past](https://preview.redd.it/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)

&#x200B;

Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. 

**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**

When faced with ""excessive buying"" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as ""Naked"" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are ""making markets"" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.

**TLDR**

**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**

2211,Please Help Me Calculate Fair GME Price (post-squeeze),m5zooc,"I would like to form my own conclusion as to what GME stock price should realistically settle at, after all the dust settles.

I'm calculating the expected market cap of a company (like Gamestop), post-pivot.

Please let me know if I make any mistakes in calculating, that is why I am posting this, for feedback.

# Here is my work so far...

The expected size of the gaming industry toward the end of 2021: $**200B**

IF GameStop manages to capture just 1-2% of **this** market, that's **$2** to **$4B earnings. Not to mention the other industries GameStop will be involved in.**

*(source:* [*https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-profit*](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-profit)*)*

# What PE would GameStop realistically trade at?

Well, if we check related sector averages, we will find:

\- E-Commerce (Online Retail) PE 129.05, Exp growth **20.17%**

\- Retail (Distributor) PE 21.91, Exp growth **10%**

\- Software (Entertainment), PE 109.44, Exp growth **19.72%**

\- Gaming Industry, PE 27, Exp growth **12%**

&#x200B;

I place a very conservatives estimate of PE at **30**, based on the weight and distribution of probable revenue streams, rounding down to remain conservative.

&#x200B;

*(source:*[*http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/pedata.html*](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)*)*

&#x200B;

Let's low-ball **this** average and go with **25 PE**, to be very safe.

So..

25 PE \* 2B = **50B** market cap, at a conservative low-end.

25 PE \* 4B = **100B** market cap, at a conservative high-end.

Currently, at $216/share, its sitting at roughly **14.5B** market cap.

In order to reach the expected **market cap of 50-100B**, the share price would need to increase by 3.4x to 6.9x the current stock price, assuming the number of outstanding shares remains constant.

for a conservative low-end, I get: 216.80 \* 3.4 = **$737**

for a conservative high-end, I get: 216.80 \* 6.9 = **$1495**

**Given the current situation and demand for GME shares, is it reasonable to assume the fair market value of a GME share is** ***at least*** **$700??**

&#x200B;

**This is my legitimate attempt at finding a realistic share value.**

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes,  I am fairly new to investing, so any advice would be appreciated. thanks.

&#x200B;

obligatory: 🦍🍌🙌💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌘🪐🌌

\*Update- Thanks for the responses and discussion so far, I realize have not taken into consideration that in-game microtransactions/Asia-Pacific account for a large majority of the current gaming industry.

I also did not properly account for the radical, possibly disruptive, changes GameStop can have on the Gaming Industry as a whole, and the RC vision of digital-first.

Also, its likely they won't be confined to just one industry either. PC parts and a Streaming Service are certainly possible.

I recommend everyone go back and read (or ""you tube"") the letter RC sent GME back in November to refresh your memories on the vision of this company, in order to fairly evaluate it.

...and I totally fucked up and used the 2019 Gross profit, instead of Net. Will recalculate later.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Update\*\*

Anyways, if anyone's interested I figured the **most** **conservative value I would value Gamestop** would be **$291.85** (factors in the post-hype post-squeeze).

This predicates on my theory they can generate 1b net profit in the first 1-2 Years, given the unprecedented demand and I believe streaming will play a vital role, like Twitch. Essentially I see them as the potential ""Amazon of Gaming"", having their hands across multiple sectors.

I predict they won't just ease into the market, they will DISRUPT it.

Other competitors playing around in the gaming industry won't be able to compete, there will be massive return from retail investors, whether they previously gamers or not.

Opportunities:

\-**Hit the ground Running with strategic locations, (In-store Streamed Events??)**

\-H**yper-growth ecommerce shift**

\-**Gaming PCs in higher demand.**

\-C**apture microtransaction market by,**

\-Large audience shift to Gamestop brand **over** competitors, for same products.

\-Resurgence of audience demanding of new Gaming Content and Live INTERACTION!!

So, **at least 1B annual revenue in next 1 to 2 yrs,**

and a, *very conservative*, **30 PE (based on related industry averages weighted by profit estimates by sector).**

...then I gave the whole ""successful rebrand"" thing an **82% chance** of happening (lol idk, take it or leave it).

So yeah, **$291.85**, super conservative, this would be my floor essentially.

Realistically, I am calculating that GME price should **naturally** hover anywhere from $300-$500, (much potential, wide range) assuming constant number of shares, ofc.

All this talk about buying ITM options on GME made me realize this potential for RKT. It just clicked.

2. Finra shows short interest at 34.45%

1. It’s in an uptrend look at how close we are to pushing 50k of 28.89s open interest contracts this week into the money.
2. RKT is on an uptrend and support is moving up above 26. As it moves up you WILL see volume. You WILL see wales put buying pressure. The last RKT move was a short squeeze, this will be a gamma squeeze and short squeeze.

Open interest is 50k on 28.89s this week. If this gets ITM market makers will buy shares to cover. Guess what??? Once they buy those shares..the price will put 33.89s ITM. Then MM have to buy more shares....Guess what?!! There is another 15k of open interest contracts at 38.89!! Guess what? There is another 22k of open interest at 48.89s!

Yes there is more! Shorts will piss their pants so it will not only gamma squeeze but also short squeeze at the same damn time. This is not a stock you want to fuck with.

Ok one last time it gets better. New options will open up and retail will start buying in late as always. While shorts cover these higher options at 60-70 will start getting ITM too. MM will have to buy more shares to cover.

Don’t limit the possibility of this. Look at the facts.

Wait...There is a possibility of more. Say shorts start shorting it at $60 -$70 a share. They hammer it down. Then Dan and Jay think mhmm..we should initiate 1 billion dollar buy back at this good price of $40 a share. They get squeezed again and more contracts are itm. This could moon January GME style.

Not financial advice but damn will you just look at it?!

2250,Option activity GME Puts: Open Interest over Volume,m5ym4a,"So I was surfing the 3/19 option chain for GME Friday mid-day when 3/12's were about to expire and noticed some sizable volume well over open interest in the 195 and 200 puts.  (I later saw some lesser volume higher at 230 put strike.)  Obviously were some new contracts getting written at the 195 level.

[3\/12\/2021 about mid day in 3\/19 contracts \(Open Int. far right, Volume 2nd from right\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqwutaavkan61.jpg?width=1369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b2dc9bef6439fcf5cddba083bcde66065402f7)

So I Youtubed bearish put straddles Friday night and mused the aim was to write the contracts for the funding to push the price down to the 230 range the next week.  Not to the levels of the price on the contracts of 195-200.

So I wasn't appalled this morning on coffee break when I saw the big drop.  Here's a snapshot of the option prices after the drop.  Think they made a killing on the option? Nope!  Delta ate into the price since 3/19 contracts are now prime time for the buzzer Friday 4pm.

[3\/15\/2021 \(3\/19 contract chain\) post drop 10:30 CDT ](https://preview.redd.it/grzf93o5oan61.jpg?width=1369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c880d10abebcd74199ab0f029bc32e6bf975a276)

The drop gained some cred and psych for the put peddlers.  Looks like more volume at the 200 strike.  See the open interest much higher as a result of the Friday put writing at 195-200. 

At the close I snapshotted and highlighted some observations.

[3\/15\/2021 close \(3\/19 GME chain\)](https://preview.redd.it/miiufbvkpan61.jpg?width=1380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdddaffe1c968aa9e1d8bdb84e4c8b2d69bad1b1)

Looks like a lot of the big volume was in and out of other strikes, but the action is 2 to 3 times higher than open interest in the (Out-of-the-Money) OTM Puts (ovaled in green).  Still, the price of the 200 put (in red) is at the Friday prices, for now, due to the ticking expiration or Delta. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Lace up Diamond Hands.  Action is not on the B-Ball courts Friday.  Looks like heavy money in the 200 and below puts.  I am not leaving!! 💎🤲 HODL HODL HODL 🍌🍌🍌

I myself is a strong ape and lit a zoot to the dip to try and get it high again. But I do think this could be a tactic to take our gains from GME as well as have more shares to short if people paper hand.

What do fundamentals mean anymore? Look at Tesla. You can’t go by fundamentals alone. So those of you saying the fundamentals aren’t there, STOP FOLLOWING WHATS HAPPENING WITH GME, move on we don’t need you. This is about upholding a brand that we believe in and we want to succeed. 

I have wanted to sell, but after seeing how much it is being manipulated, I will never sell. There’s much more at stake than getting a quick ROI. In January, it would have easily hit 1k if it weren’t for the cowardly actions of corporations.

GOOD JOB YOU FUCKING APES!

$14.04 close on the day and I see a new price target of $2008.01 for many like minded investors. I'll be subscribing to that school of thought myself. Before we continue!

This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Any price targets discussed are those of my own choosing and the decisions to continue to invest are entirely my own and I would not suggest you do anything farther than your own comfort allows.

We opened at $12.18 after closing at ($11.14 I believe?) On Friday....and then went on to a MONSTEROUS day today closing at $14.04! Awesome. But why?

1. News. 3:00 p.m Friday an article circulated of a short interview with the CEO of $AMC. It was a small glimmer for Apes to come but didn't come to fruition until AH (After Hours). The announcement was the hard line drawn in the sand by the CEO that the LA Market (Largest Market they have) would, 100%, open by this Friday.

2. Volume. 287 million in Volume today. About 200 million Friday. (Probably more, I don't remember). For reference...$GME was only at 24 million....yep. People see where the short is now. Volume will always drive buying activity, even if just for scalping, which always leads to Options, which leads to Gamma (more later).

3. ""Unusual Options activity"". This notice goes out when mad volume of Options are going out. In this particular case....Puts. about 5800 of them for a $9 price target. That's right, more money going AGAINST $AMC. What did you Apes do? That's right. YOU BOUGHT MORE!!!! Not only did this not hurt us, it simply showcased how the stock is being shorted...as if we needed more of that. But the more the merrier.

4. Gamma Build Up (Calls expiring ITM). No, we are not yet In a Gamma Squeeze. This has all been organic growth, which is far better in the long term. HOWEVER. 2 Weeks ago we landed the much needed $8.01. This lead to calls expiring ITM. (This doesn't always guarantee bought shares, more later)

-The Following week we close at $11. Once again...more ITM option calls, which leads to today. Pre-Market took us above $12 putting more calls ITM, which lead to $13 quickly doing the same. And the we found a new support base around $14. This is all chasing the $15 Option Mark where we have TONS of support waiting. 

5. The Witching Hour. Quadruple Witching on the EXACT SAME DAY $AMC Launches it's largest Market. Very frightening for Short positions that have been consistently losing millions.

Options Explained, FAQ
 Because there is A LOT of confusion on this.

- Do Options expiring ITM guarantee bought shares? Not necessarily. 

-Why? Because when your Option goes ITM and you ""Sell-To-Close"" you are selling the option contract back to the Exchange, not another human being.

-If the Exchange is buying it, don't they still need to buy Shares? Kinda. If they already have the shares, which they do, most of the time, then no, but they have to constantly purchase and sell shares through the exchange so as the Gamma builds up and raises the prices then the exchanges are paying more money for the shares which nets the outcome we are all looking for, which is BOUGHT SHARES. The more Options expiring ITM, also inspires massive Buying activity (always) whoch results in more people buy Shares (including other hedgies and whales who also want the price to go up) which leads to a constant feed back loop.

TL;DR: Options drive Buying Power and help raise the stock price even though they do not directly influence share price when bought or sold. $AMC has big things coming. Buy & Hold, Rinse & Repeat!

The only answer is that they cannot afford to see GME not only go up but stay up...

2312,Short Melvin and Citadel's Portfolio,m5x5xv,"It has become apparent through recent events that the fate of Citadel and Melvin Capital are inextricably linked.  One might even say Melvin Capital is a thinly veiled shell company for Citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure.  

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.  

https://preview.redd.it/uxctj2oi2em61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=378c368c44c2dc85abff6ba29ba59697ca6f3176

&#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",1615885313.0

2339,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,m5wglc,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

I think the most important takeaway from this is that they are BBB- rated.  For those of you that do not know much about bond ratings, there are two ""main"" types of ratings with many ""sub-ratings"": investment-grade and non-investment-grade.  High-rated investment-grade bonds typically have low-interest rates but are pretty much guaranteed to pay out.  Low-rated non-investment-grade bonds typically have high-interest rates but have a lower chance of paying out.  Why is BBB- important as a rating that Citadel received for its bonds? Well, because it is the LOWEST investment-grade bond rating.  Right on the border of non-investment-grade.  (Insert conspiracy theory here)

&#x200B;

TL;DR They are issuing medium-risk investment-grade bonds at a time when they are claiming that everything is fine.

2366,Pricing Mechanics or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love GME's Dips,m5vnas,"Listen up fellow smooth-brained apes. I get it, ending the day in the red sucks. It can also take an emotional toll if you allow. But there is something about GME pricing that I've seen a few people mention but not go into depth explaining. And it's pretty freaking important to understand:

First: **The value of currency, goods, or services is only worth the value YOU place upon it.** If that's not ape enough for you: banana worth whatever ape want.

Repeat the above a few times and let it sink in. This is not an oversimplification, it's a fundamental of economics.

Everyone is conditioned from the time they are a baby ape to trust what they are told something costs. Ever since you got your first allowance (if you were lucky) so you could ""learn the value of money"" you've been conditioned to think a good or service is worth what other people tell you.

Think about it: You go to the store to buy a pack of gum ""That'll be $1"", and you say ""Okay, if you say so"". Or as an ape, you go to the store to buy a banana ""That'll be $1"", and you grunt ""Banana good"". Rinse and repeat for the majority of things apes buy without question.

Over time, apes will start assigning intrinsic value to currency based on the pricing they see over and over for goods and services. This is why uncool boomers complain all the time about how a soda cost 5 cents back in their day. People become conditioned to expect X costs $Y.

### That's deep, but what does this have to do with stocks?

As some wrinkly brained apes get smarter, they may not take everything at face value and instead shop around for sellers with a better deal on that Banana. Basically, finding someone who assigned the same value to the good or service as them. When and if that occurs, they are both happy and willing to conduct the trade. It goes both ways, if you have a banana to sell you want to find the ape willing to pay the most. In the most simple sense, this is ""tHE MaRkET"".

Buyers and sellers are continuously trying to find each other in the market. But driving around in apemobiles across the country to find the perfect match is a pain in the ass. This is where marketplaces come into the picture.

A marketplace is a venue (physical or virtual) that serves to connect buyers with sellers. It's a great racket to be in, as those who operate the marketplace typically take a cut of every trade. Sound familiar? eBay? Amazon? NYSE? Because for most apes, it's worth not driving around to find the best price on 1 banana.

### I already know what is a marketplace!

Maybe so, but let me connect the dots.

The purpose of the marketplace is to match apes __willing__ to trade at the __same price__. In stock market terms this is ""bid"" and ""ask"" prices. So if one ape is willing to buy a banana for $1, and another ape is willing to sell a banana for $1, and that's the best price for both, a marketplace like NYSE matches them up automatically to conduct the trade.

Let's take a theoretical case of a stock that has only 1 share, 1 buyer, and 1 seller. If the buyer enters a limit order of $100, and the seller enters a limit order of $200 - no trade will occur. Those orders will just sit there and do nothing. In stock market terms this is trade volume, and in this case it's a big fat zero every minute of trading hours.

What if both apes had set their limit buy/sell orders for $150? The marketplace (NYSE) sees ""Hey, these two apes agree on a price, let me just conduct that trade for you."" This happens in a split second given computers are continuously looking at the backlog of buyers and sellers waiting to match. This backlog is also known as Market Depth, or Level 2 trading information.

(Bonus brain wrinkle: If either ape had set a market order instead of a limit order, the NYSE would automatically conduct trade at whatever price the other ape set. This is why market orders are probably not what most apes want to do. You never know who else might show up with a price you don't agree with.)

### Come on already, what is your point?

Now that everyone reading this should have the same understanding of the marketplace (NYSE) at this point, let's discuss how volume has an impact.

In the example above I use 1 buyer and 1 seller. Once their trade executed, it was a volume of one. If both buyer and seller had their limits set to $150, the NYSE would reflect a stock price of $150. Simple enough, right?

But what if there were 10 *potential* sellers with a share, 9 of which are diamond-handed apes, but 1 of those was a hedgehog and wanted to drive down price? We already know the 9 apes value their shares at $1M and are not __willing__ to sell for the __same price__ that the buyer is bidding ($150). Let’s say the NYSE shows the last trade price as $420k. All it takes is for that one hedgehog to put in a sell order for $150 and BAM! NYSE then shows the last trade price as $150, not the $1M that the 9 other apes value the stock to be. This is because NYSE did what is supposed to do and match a buyer and a seller that agreed on the same price. 

""Preposterous! Market manipulation!"" the apes scream, as they start throwing shit around their cages. Unfortunately as a result, 1 of those apes may become paper hands after their primitive visual cortex lights up seeing $150 on NYSE and triggers a prehistoric behavior that says ""banana worth what other ape tell me it worth"" and starts mashing the sell button.

Well good job you stupid ape. You let 1 hedgehog tell you what you think your share is worth, and therefore made it a reality. Ignoring the 9 other apes that think it's worth $1M. You’ve been conditioned your whole life to let a sticker price tell you what something is worth and haven’t evolved. Pathetic.

### So the last trade price on NYSE isn't really what the stock is worth?

No. Whether it be 10 apes or 10 million apes, NYSE is not going to reflect what the other apes value the shares to be. The last trade price is exactly that, the __last trade__. This is why trade volume is so important, anything less than 1M volume can easily affect the last trade price. But that's not the value of the shares! Repeat with me: ""The last trade price is not the value of the shares!""

### TLDR;

* The HFs know that apes are conditioned to think money has value.
* Share prices don’t reflect what people think it’s worth, they only reflect the __last trade__.
* The HFs also know they can easily manipulate the __last trade__ price on low volume.
* The HFs are screwed as long as apes don't let NYSE ticker tell them what they should value the shares to be.

2373,NSCC Rules DD - the vicious cycle of margin and SLD,m5v5r4,"We'll try this one more time to catch more ape eyes

Ok so I've outlined a majority of things in my DDs, ranging from what the new rules mean, the margin and the matrix etc (please go back and read my previous DD if you think I'm not making sense). 

In this DD, I'm setting out what I think they all might mean for this trading week, as we all know it's a biggie. Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.

A lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.

So this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. 

Further, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short members as time progresses. 

I'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 1**
So first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. 

Remember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. 

Therefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.

This in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 2**
The new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.

Edit: Oh Citadel is issuing bonds for money are they? I wonder why....

This alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.

As we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 3**
If the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.

Edit 2: Thanks to the comments, this is actually looking likely that this change will come into play in minimum 70 days, I don't think it affects the vicious circle and hey, if the fight goes on this long this step will still be relevant

This means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.

This is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. 

Which in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?

_______________________________________________________

**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**

This is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. 

Sorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go 🚀.

Therefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.

TLDR: The current and new NSCC rules represent a vicious cycle which could force short positions to default, which in turn, allows the NSCC and co to step in a close out their positions

Remember we are up tremendously compared to the past month. I bought in at 350 and saw that shit dip to 40. There IS a time limit, here. This can last months; understand that. But, we have a lot of potential catalysts. Earnings on the 23rd, potential news on Cohen as CEO, announcements for pivoting to digital markets, etc. DFV was never even interested in the squeeze (though the squeeze can and likely will happen, in my opinion. Just not for a while); he was interested in the company's potential to grow. Buy the dips, hold steady, REMOVE YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES and for the love of God stop buying 800c OTM bullshit. You may as well write Melvin a check every time you do. Buy as close ITM or simply stocks as you can make them hedge this shit. They cannot keep this up forever, they already are 6.8 billion in the hole THAT WE KNOW OF.

This is a war of attrition; I assure you, it very well may crash below 100 again and it likely will shoot right back up because this rocket will not stop short of a hand-written tendie slip from God himself. Quit panicking, quit the 19th or bust bullshit, and hold. Set price alerts and walk away. Come back when you're rich. Go fap or something, idk.

This is not financial advise, this is 💎🙌🦍 advice.

Edit 1: So I’m been getting a lot of comments about me being a shill, hedgie, bot, etc... So let me end this retardness

Yes, I joined Reddit 41 days ago. The same day Mark Cuban came here to chat with us. I like some apes here bought GME in January out of fomo. I saw the stock go up and then crash down to the 50s. I’m usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to “get rich quick.” When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to “HOLD!” I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I’ve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it’s much much more. It’s NOT about ME, it’s about 🦍. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn’t agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you’re just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I’m trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there’s more than one way to help the cause than buying.

So some of y’all can continue to criticize me, I really don’t care. I’m going to continue to help and educate others.

Finally if that story isn’t convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. 

Hopefully that convinces the naysayers that I’m a 💎🙌🦍!",1615866651.0

This is a continuation from my other post. [Pt 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll68pc/the_sec_just_posted_the_new_numbers_for_failure/)  I wrote a [pt 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvf0uv/the_sec_just_posted_the_new_numbers_for_failure/) but the gay mods never approved it.

Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for a lot of weeks now.   This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act  (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.   This is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.  Why is this being allowed, why was this not brought up at the hearings?

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The     figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that    includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.      In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a   specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to   yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

>In     order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the     restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified     fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.      Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold     securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for     a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,    the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver   position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule   203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with   large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

Company overview:

Inseego's Wavemaker PRO 5G indoor router FG2000e received industry certifications that make it commercially available for deployments in all global markets.

Inseego announces sale of Ctrack operations in South Africa.  From the above article on Feb 24th, here's CEO Dan Mondor's quote: “The sale of our South African Ctrack operations is part of Inseego’s strategy to focus solely on target markets that are closely aligned with the growth of our 5G business.  The proceeds further strengthen our balance sheet and increases liquidity to address our growing 5G pipeline.

Earnings call.  I'm not going to list all the things they have done in the last year (they did A LOT), you can read the article yourself. Here are the company highlights from the previous year:

* 2020 full year net revenue of $313.8 million, up 43.0% year-over-year, and Q4 2020 net revenue of $86.1 million, up 64.5% year-over-year
* Year-end cash balance of $40.0 million in the quarter with zero bank debt
* More stuff - go read the article.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/08/why-inseego-stock-dropped-last-month/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/08/why-inseego-stock-dropped-last-month/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

This caught my eye because after the earnings call on March 1st, it dropped a lot on seemingly no bad news - the highlights were amazing.  What I found interesting is that the consensus was that investors were spooked because the company execs said that they expect 4G demand to be down in 2021.  To me, that makes perfect sense because if you are focusing on 5G, why would you promote lesser technology?

Highlighted Statistics:

Market cap of 1.152B.  Also, INSG has a float of only 77M.  It is also a heavily shorted stock, with 20.04M shares shorted, a short ratio of 6.91, and a 31.69% short percentage of float as of Feb 26.  The options are very cheap as well right now.

Conclusion:  

Again, I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice.  Do your own research.  Could this be another candidate for a short squeeze?  Seems like it easily could be with a low float and ridiculously high short percentage.  Especially for a company with a very good business model (5G) that is currently trading in the 11 dollar range.  But even if it doesn't get squeezed, they are focusing towards 5G with the earnings call on 3/1 and the selling of their Ctrack in south africa.  Factor in the general population moves towards working from home, teaching remotely, and remote healthcare because of the pandemic and 5G is going to be the industry standard sooner than later.

Given that not everyone has gotten their stimmies and the time it'll take for transfers, buy orders and settlement...I think we are yet to witness the effects of the stimulus on the GME. Like many have said, I think this week will be relatively calm in regards to upward movement. This is good cause it'll give us a chance to get in at the best price before we push up. I'm thinking next week will be good.

2740,Nokia and Its “Infamous” Float,m5oe2p,"Listen up you absolute retards. 

I’m sick and tired of hearing the narrative passed around:

 “Hurr durr Nokia Float too big- Nokia never move”

Here are some fun facts as of writing this post:

1) Regardless of how “large the float is”, Nokia’s market cap right now is ~24 billion and is trading at $4.30/share. 

2) Guess what hot company everyone has loved FOMOing into for the last 3 months? GME. Do you retards want to know what the market cap is for GME right now? ~25 billion while trading at $250/share. 

Quite literally the only thing required for Nokia to move at the same rate as GME is for buyers to buy ~58 shares of Nokia for every one share you’d have bought of GME. You’d have spent literally the same amount on your investment with either choice. 

Not only that, but as you’d have more shares amassed in quantity, when Nokia’s value is recognized and it booms, you’ll be able to make even MORE cash by selling covered calls against your shares. 

If you wanted even more leverage, because I know you retards do, you could buy LEAPs now, and sell calls against them either now or in the future after the leaps have appreciated massively in value. 

And, make no mistake, Nokia is set to boom. They just announced major deals today with the biggest tech companies in the world- Amazon, Microsoft, Google. That’s not even mentioning the non-stop contracts they’ve won globally the last few months- major contracts. The investing community is ignoring this diamond in the rough, but those that get in now on the ground floor are the ones that are going to see significant returns. 

Do your own DD. Make your own decisions. But...

For fucks sake, inform yourselves on what it takes to move a companies shares price. All Nokia needs is buying volume and a willingness for investors to recognize the value staring them in the face. 

I recommend both shares and LEAPs as the plays here. 

I’m holding 250 1/21/22 10c

2788,How Is The System Still So Rigged Against Us?,m5nkzb,"The last year was tough. I've got a kid to feed, you know. So I've been here looking to make some money alongside the rest of you apes, and I was willing to take the risk. When GME dropped to less than 50 only a week after record highs, I knew things were not over. So I bought in and have been happily watching the gains these past few weeks.

Thing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say ""would have been"" because I did not buy that option. Not because I didn't want to, but because I wasn't ALLOWED to do so. What gives? The little guy can't get access to real trading strategies? Wall Street has to screw us over like that?

I mean hey, I understand having to ask for approval first. Accept the risks and all that. So fine, I did that. Robinhood gave me a big FU. Fidelity, which has been my brokerage app, said I needed to wait a few days. On Friday I was told I got approved. Awesome. All good now, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm a little guy, so the only position I am entitled to is being screwed.

This week I decided to start small, grab one Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 200 in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22. How can I ever get experience if you won't let me try?

If anyone knows a place with enough integrity to give the little guy a chance, I would love to know. I deserve a chance to learn.

EDIT: Went back to Robinhood on someone's advice, said I have some experience trading options. Instantly approved for Level 3. They are certifiably insane over there.",1615851991.0

2865,$SKT- The hybrid squeeze/Corona recovery play 🚀🚀$SKT🚀🚀,m5m8kg,"In my quest to outretard the rest of you, I’m always looking for the next big thing, and after doing my own DD, I’m convinced SKT is the next one to lift off.

The skinny:  To summarize,  SKT is an REIT specializing in outlet mall space.  it has very high short interest (~40%%) with a relatively low number of shares outstanding (~90M).  One of the biggest short holders is our old pal, Melvin Capital.  Essentially SKT is GME's Downie brother who has been squirreled away to the back room to wonder why no one is paying him any attention.  Let's give him some.

The thesis of those holding short positions is that retail is dying, and that the ‘Rona was going to hasten its death.   That seemed like a reasonable hypothesis early on in the pandemic- but that hypothesis has collapsed, yet they haven't closed their shorts.

Early on in the pandemic, a TON of stores closed down.  In April of last year, only 1% of stores that had shut down had reopened (as a percentage of occupied stores).  By June 3, 56% had reopened, and by Jan 31, 99% had.  

In the Q4 last year, they were able to collect 95% of their usual payments.  Their recovery has been amazing, and we’re only just now starting to see people start to return to less cautious lifestyles.   The fact that they are outdoor outlets helps that proposition.

SKT certainly faces some headwinds- it’s in a challenging business during a challenging time, much like our friends at GME.  But it’s not in such a terrible position to warrant 40% short interest.  A week or so we gave it a little squeeze, a gentle caress really, and it gave some ground.  It seems like if we were to reach around and use both hands this time,  with one firmly gripping the gamma, we’d really see it fly.  A $200 target has been thrown around here on WSB; I feel like trying to put a certain number on it is just guesswork, but I do feel like there is room for this to jump.  

So, you like beaten down retail plays with high short interest?  Why not get in on the ground floor and buy the whole fookin’ mall?  $$SKT$$SKT

2887,Bullish GME OBV Indicator,m5lk3l,"This post is going to be a deep dive into the On-balance volume indicator for GME. Before I start, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am but a simple, smooth-brained ape with StimmyYOLO dreams. 

**What is OBV**: On-balance volume is a technical indicator, which was founded on the idea that volume precedes price. OBV is calculated as a running total where the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). For example (these are arbitrary numbers), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. It's also important to note that if a candle stays the same, it is not added to OBV (this doesn't really matter for GME because its price RARELY stays the same). OBV is a trend indicator, so the actual value of OBV doesn't matter, the trend of OBV is what matters. Generally, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. I usually use OBV when a stock is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price.

**GME OBV Charts:** Here is GME's 1 year, 90 day, 30 day, and 10 day charts with volume and OBV. Volume is the graph with green and red candles below the chart and OBV is the tan line in the volume graph:

**Analysis:** The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move. 

**Now what:** I made a previous technical analysis on GME a few days ago (this one didn't have OBV because my smooth brain forgot to. Trust me, my wife's boyfriend was PISSED that I forgot, so I made this so he would let me sleep in the garage instead of under the deck tonight). In that post, I said ""Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume."" I'd just like to reiterate that. For another squeeze to happen, we need MASSIVE volume. OBV continually increasing is a good thing because it shows that volume is on the side of the buyer, so when volume increases, it will be easier for the price to skyrocket. In that post, I also said that in order for volume to increase, especially in the case of GME, there has to be a catalyst. Previous volume increases coincided with Ryan Cohen being added to the board, celebrities tweeting about GME, Shitron's short position, and the ousting of the CFO. I believe that we have a few upcoming catalysts that could help push up volume: Earnings, quadruple witching day (not a catalyst in and of itself but it is a day that always has significant volume), and any kind of announcement relating to getting a new CFO or Cohen doing something. The stimmys that so many of us have is just kerosine being added to that fire. 

**A note on predictions:** What I want to emphasize, especially for the new apes, is that while I believe this (the squeeze) will happen, do not get discouraged if it takes a while. WSB is a glorious hub of information. Much of this information is comparable to what actual analysts do (many people on CNBC have talked about the sophistication of WSB research). There are many DDs in this sub that explain why HFs are trying to delay the squeeze but that it's still inevitable. The catalysts that I mentioned are just that, catalysts - they are not predictions. So when you are up at 3am ripping your juul after having jacked off for the 5th time that day while and scrolling through the DD section on WSB, don't get tied down to dates and predictions. You should have conviction in your positions and if you are confident that it will rise based on technicals, fundamentals, and theories, the conviction of your play should not be affected by a date. Think of dates simply as ""oh something could happen on this day, but if not, IDGAF because I have conviction in my play.""

2919,Why AMC is not the same as GME,m5kpnb,"Ok retards, listen up. Just because AMC has performed in lockstep in the past with GME does not mean this will continue indefinitely.

AMC is not GME. AMC’s management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from >50% to <10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren’t buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn’t actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.

If you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution. Please let me know what I’m missing.

So here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!

## Why Hedge?
It's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.


Aknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.

This guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.

For convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.

## Imagine this scenario!
Your favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. 

If one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -> 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.


And now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.

Some quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.


Hedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.

The runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k

The dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.


The hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.

But that ""rebalancing"" is key here and makes all the difference.


## Rebalancing
If your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.

Initially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.

Stocks after the runup: 80%*$116k/$120 -> ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)


But the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll ""have to"" buy shares for $3.2k. 

Total stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k / $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)


Since you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.


Briefly:

### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.
### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in

## When to rebalance
That's not easy to answer. If you're asking r/investing folks monthly is more than enough but we're not investing in super stable low volatile ETFs here.

My rule of thumb is to rebalance when the planned allocation exceeds 10%. Want to use 20% for hedging? If your hedge goes below 18% or above 22% a rebalance could make sense. Since we're on WSB here people might hit 10% swings every single day and that's WAY too often.


So rebalancing maximum once per week and only if the allocation is off by 20% (so 16% or 24% with a 20% hedge) could be a sensible strategy.

But you'll have to see what works for you. Rebalancing too often means paying the spread every time for both the hedge and the bet and that adds up.


## What can be used to hedge?
There are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.

You should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.

### Options

Options are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. 

Books have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading ""The Greeks and Hedging Explained"" by P. Leoni for that.


Very, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).

### Currency
This is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.

### Precious Metals
Precious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.

I don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.

There are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.
### SPACs (No, really!)
SPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.

That's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.


So why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.


What to look out for / type into google: Near NAV SPACs.

### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)
You _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.

So if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.

If you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.

I really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure / telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.

### Inverse Funds
Thanks to u/A_KY_gardener for brining these to my attention! Inverse funds don't exist for every stock or index but they can be used as a hedge on these, too. 

Basically whenever whatever they invert goes up, they go down and vice versa. 


They are a bit awkward to use since they're inherently as volatile as their underlying stock/index, but whenever the entire market goes deep into the red they're going to shine bright and green, offering some tendies to buy the dip.



There is one boring reason you can use them, depending on your local tax law, and that's to create losses on paper. If you bet both long on a stock or index and the same amount into these inverse funds then one of them will be up roughly whatever the other leg is down. If you realize the losses in the end of december then you'll have realized losses but unrealized gains going into the new year. That can delay the taxes to pay and you get to gamble with that tax money. 

## TL;DR
Want to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.


## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!
### Hedgefunds bad
Yes.
### Hedgefunds hedge?
They used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.
The goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.


This has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.

Art, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. 


They do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.
### The shorting meta
You've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.


Imagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.

Since both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.

That's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _""They're the good guys""_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.

2949,Simplifying Law DD series Part III - the vicious cycle of margin and SLD,m5jlem,"Ok so I've outlined a majority of things in my DDs, ranging from what the new rules mean, the margin and the matrix etc (please go back and read my previous DD if you think I'm not making sense). 

In this DD, I'm setting out what I think they all might mean for this trading week, as we all know it's a biggie. Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.

A lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.

So this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. 

Further, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short members as time progresses. 

I'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 1**
So first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. 

Remember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. 

Therefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.

This in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 2**
The new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.

Edit: Oh Citadel is issuing bonds for money are they? I wonder why....

This alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.

As we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 3**
If the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.

This means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.

This is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. 

Which in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?

_______________________________________________________

**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**

This is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. 

Sorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go 🚀.

Therefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.

TLDR: The current and new NSCC rules represent a vicious cycle which could force short positions to default, which in turn, allows the NSCC and co to step in a close out their positions

I'm thinking about buying RKT at market open and selling by end of week.I cant play options cuz europoor.

So  the logic is this: Special dividend is on march 23rd and i dont think  people wont sell until then so risk is minimal. In general it could drop  to 20 long term but i can take that risk. Open interest on call options  is at 200.000 OTM call options at 30 and below. Even like 100.000 more  between 30-50. If those calls get ITM there could be a huge gamma  squeeze as banks would need to hedge up to 30 million shares+. Thats 30%  of the float.

The Problem:  
RKT  has a market cap of almost 50 billion. However the float is only at 2.5  billion right now. Most shares are tied up with instutions and i think  the CEO has like 75% of all shares. Dont hold me to those numbers but it  looks something like that. Also as far as i understand the float  consists of class A(no voting power) shares and the  institutions/insiders own mostly class D(voting power) shares which are  convertible to class A shares.(I'm probably retarded and this isnt true)

So  the question is do the banks and institutional investors who own most  of the stock sell the options and already have the underlying or do the  banks need to purchase the underlying from float and there giving the  possibility of a gamma squeeze. Also are they able to just ""sell"" their  shares thru options this way diluting the float? I mean the option  sellers would make money anyway because of premium + yuge profit since  they prolly bought at <20.

TLDR:

Im  betting on a gamma squeeze since float is only 2-3 billion(high option  activity). Problem is if option sellers already have the shares or need  to purchase them to cover.",1615839301.0

Most of the time when both exchanges are open for trading they seem to be moving in nearly the same way but where my ape brain starts to break down is how would this work if the squeeze was happening in a few scenarios.

For example if GME gets the squeezes will GS2C also get squozen automatically?

What happens when the squeeze happens when NYSE is still closed and only GS2C can be traded and same question for the reverse situation?

Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*

**RECAP** : With the borrow rate declining and available shares to short increasing, waiting around for the short squeeze might take some time.

https://preview.redd.it/a7povkgre6n61.jpg?width=349&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07f74b1a6d7beefd747dcf4b47feebbeccf0f4e3

We aim to speed it up by triggering a prelude gamma squeeze leading to the short squeeze.

**1. Why Call Options and Gamma Squeeze ?**

Specific option strikes and expiries provides much greater leverage vs buying shares directly due to Market Makers delta hedging the option calls they sell.

**2. Why this week 3/19 ?**

Earnings is set for 3/23 however at the current price point, >80% of the value is dependent on successful future business transformation instead of the current Q performance.

Due to the structure of the current $GME option chains OI and external conditions such as the quad witching(the index futures, index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously on March's 3rd Friday) and new DTCC regulations, 3/19 provides the highest probability of success.

**3. What we aim to achieve :**

# $GME > $650 by end of week.

**4. What 🦍🦍🦍 should be buying**

**OTM Options (HIGH RISK BUT CHEAP)**

Buying the 570C 3/19 for about $800-$1000/contract would trigger MMs delta hedging 15 shares of $GME or about $3967 worth at current prices. If $GME prices goes up since gamma is positive the delta will increase triggering further buy ins by the MMs as shown by the projected delta and amplification values. The following table and graphs simulates the delta hedging for the 570C 3/19 at different underlying share prices

**5. Can I just buy shares**

Sure it's the safer way however it would take a lot more gross value of share buying compared to options, see point 7

**6. Can I buy the 800C 3/19 ?**

Not if you want to help the cause, many degenerates did it last week and ended up giving free money to MMs.

If  🦍 buy the mentioned OTM strikes

`🦍 1 🍌 <--> 🐊 4.6 🍌`

`1 🦍 🍌 force evil MMs croc to buy 4.6 🍌`

If 🦍 buy the 800C 3/19

`🦍 1 🍌 --> 🤣 🐊 0 🍌`

`Evil MMs croc laugh at 🦍 and say thx for free banana`

**7. How much 🦍🦍🦍 and 🍌🍌🍌 would it take to get $GME to $650 by 3/19**

Assuming no 🦍 paper handed, any one of the following would do

* OTM Options : 40,000 apes with 1k banana each (less 🍌)
* ITM Options : 20,000 apes with 8k banana each (medium 🍌🍌)
* Plain Shares : 800,000 apes with 1k banana each (requires a lot of fucking 🍌🍌🍌)

Or a mix of the above

**8. Has anyone confirmed this would actually work ?**

This Forbes article, which actually referenced my earlier DD strike and expiries confirmed it

>Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12. The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.

>A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share.

Las Vegas — March 8, 2017— JLG Industries, Inc., an Oshkosh Corporation company \[NYSE:OSK\] and a leading global manufacturer of aerial work platforms and telehandlers, announced plans to open its new parts distribution center (PDC) in Las Vegas later this month 

\*\*\*JLG is owned by OSK, the company awarded the USPS contract.  

\*\*\*Once again pay attention to company names.   [news.xpo.com/484/xpo-logist...](https://news.xpo.com/484/xpo-logistics-launches-aftermarket-parts-distribution-network-for-jlg/)   
   
 \*\*\*Now pay attention that DeJoy used to own XPO logistics and sold it but he kept a large part of XPO by giving it to his kids.  [citizensforethics.org/repor...](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/is-louis-dejoys-xpo-logistics-divestiture-a-sham/)  

DeJoy stills owns a lot of XPO that works with JLG which is part of OSK which was awarded the USPS contract by DeJoy.  There was a large $54 million block trade made in OSK the day before the contract award.

3208,$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news. Maybe fourth time posting is the charm.,m57vcf,"Alright smooth brains, strap in. This is going to be a wild ride. I said I wouldn't post more $NOK DD...I lied.

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

My position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go 🚀🚀🚀.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Second, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.",1615795262.0

I wanted to share my DD on a company I am very bullish on $HIMS. An incoming catalyst in the form of year end 2020 earnings is set to be announced 3/18. This was trading in the 20s in February. There’s one thing people want to do....look better and have sex! Even boomers 

**About the company**

Hims & Hers Health is a is a fast growing telehealth and mail order wellness product provider. The company launched in 2017 targeting the male consumer hair regrowth and erectile dysfunction markets (my wife’s BF sometimes needs a little help \*wink wink\*) A few months later, Hers, their female health company was launched offering birth control, skin care, and hair care products.

&#x200B;

**Financial Analysis**Below are some key financial takeaways and indicators. HIMS has done a great job at retaining customers while also managing its cost to acquire them (see next section)

* Estimated 128% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2020
* 91% recurring revenue
* 71% gross margins
* Over 2 million cumulative consultations
* More than 250,000 customer subscriptions
* Sales increase expectations are 66% increase to 138 million for 2020

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

In subscription based business models, acquiring customers is an extremely costly aspect. In 2019, HIMS spent over 150 million on CAC. Through the first 2 quarters of 2020 they only spend 17 million (graph below). Keeping the same trajectory for year end 2020 would result in a 75% decrease.

3223,Simplifying Law DD series part II - NSCC rules relating to their 'watchlist' and margin,m575iw,"Here we go, another entry into the series for my own amusement as I jot things down and attempt to make legal nonsense, sense. If you other apes gain a wrinkle or two too, well that's just gravy.

Part I [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3vhmg/simplying_law_dd_series_nscc_rule_18_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Let me clarify first, the point of this series is to grant a better understanding for us apes on how the NSCC (and DTCC) does business, or any other legal stuff for that matter, relating to securities. This is to prevent FUD surrounding quotes of rules or rulings which, when taken out of context, seem like they won't help / cause fear in the DTCC and co won't pay or find a way out of paying when the inevitable squeeze happens, in addition to the new rule.

*If you don't want to read my stuff, just know the DTCC is and remains on the hook should a member default and they have so much credit, cash and assets the squeeze will hurt, but never finish them, maybe*

Anyway, I had the thought that surely the NSCC (and therefore by extension, the DTCC and sister companies) doesn't just wait until the proverbial shit hits the fan, or waits till the ass is primed in the fan's direction after a spicy meal, before it decides to protect itself. Big money likes to stay big money. You may think well no shit, but I doubt many of you know exactly how they do so.

This DD relates to what the NSCC and co does *before* a member (such as Citadel) or their family affiliates securities (such as Melvin) Default and enter Rule 18 i.e. Part I and defaults), **in addition to the new SLD filing**.

As always, not financial advice, do your own research and if that means you point to me and say stupid ape wrong, I'm glad to hear it. Fling it at me.

Onto the DD, it actually relates to an amendment of rule which is thankfully 10 pages long.

The rule amendment I'm looking at (File No. SR.-NSCC-2017-010) relates to how the NSCC detects funky trade moves from members and affiliates, and determines margin payments. Remember the NSCC handles the majority of clearing, so they know what's been traded, in the vast majority of cases. 

The FICC also knows what they're worth too, so they can assess a member and any affiliates' ability to settle their portfolio when things get hairy, both from a portfolio and financial standpoint. The NSCC and FICC work together on this.

So the NSCC has something called a 'risk matrix' which helps them determine a member's margin, or a charge they have to pay into the NSCC's clearing fund, depending on how much risk their portfolio places the NSCC under with respect to their positions and financial clout.

I can't shake the imagery that this rule is like members and their affiliates are aware the market is a simulation and get slaps on the wrist if they fuck with it, whereas we apes are forced to play by the rules, until we came along and ate the red pill that is GME when they were caught with their pants down. I digress.

The clearing fund is the 'uh oh someone may default and we need to settle' cash reserve, and it is collected from all members, even those on the right side of trades. They just pay less, but every member has to pay into it to protect the NSCC, the price of membership. The difference is, those more in risk pay more to account for their risky portfolio.

As I said, the risk matrix extends to all members and affiliates, and it represents a measurement like a credit rating. To calculate the risk, the NSCC gathers up all their member's portfolio info and the FICC tells them what each of their financial capabilities are. An algorithm then determines a rating.

As an example, you're potentially in the hole for $2b and you have a total assets and liquidity of $2.5b, matrix sends alarm bells to the NSCC of crap this member's or this affiliate is in the shit, scrape some money now or it'll hurt you later. A good member may get AAA rating if their risk is nowhere near what they're worth, so a token donation from you.

Further, if you find yourself on the NSCC watchlist, well your margin payment is going to increase too. Those on the watchlist are essentially those with a bad 'credit rating"" in the eyes of the matrix, who either continue or increase in that position, or else have failed to raise enough capital to balance their risk relative to their assets or both. This rule SPECIFICALLY brings in affiliate investments, likely so risky positions can't be held in such entities without risk.

*An aside - could this be why Citadel invested in Melvin? It's speculative but imagine you've lost billions and then you're slapped with a fat margin bill as you can't exit the position or else default, seems like a great time for a predatory institution to come in and grab your shares at discount prices. Just saying.*

So how does this relate to the situation? Well as Part I described you want to avoid defaulting as much as possible or else your ass gets liquidated.

Speculation: Now imagine you're a Melvin who's lost billions and doesn't have the capital to front the charge for your risky position, you then default and your ass gets liquidated and that's you done, out the market. Citadel steps in and 'invests' in you so you can sell out your risky positions to them and you can legally say you closed out your position and their assets make the charge less because your position in the matrix is better as you're better capitalized.

Next, you try and tank the stock but it doesn't work. Citadel then has the increased charge for their position with each day that goes by. The current SLD is measured against the last 24 months trading and the investment into Melvin you can hide as it wasn't your investment, but you're eating a lot of money in interest.

The longer this goes on for higher prices, the quicker you're done. When the SLD rules come into place and the NSCC demands a larger sum of what you can handle when the rule change passes, you default and they settle you out. The incentive is only to keep kicking the can down the road and pray retail gets bored as both of you are done if this doesn't happen. Which it won't if apes hold.

TLDR: this situation for Melvin and Citadel is like being stuck in an underwater cave and finding an oxygen tank from another trapped person. Sure, you'll last longer, but that canister will run out eventually and you're done.",1615793054.0

3239,Simplified FOMC Playbook for Smooth Brains,m568xl,"**How to play FOMC this week**

Haven’t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn’t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn’t repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I’ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don’t want to read this, I’ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven’t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I’ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don’t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There’s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won’t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We’ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn’t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won’t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it’s not about if, it’s about when. Unlikely they’ll let it fail right now. Most likely won’t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won’t let this fall because it’ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won’t let this pop right now because we’re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we’re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We’re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don’t worry it doesn’t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can’t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there’s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I’d be cautious tho. Because there’s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we’re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I’d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I’d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I’d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it’ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that’ll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you’ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it’s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don’t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren’t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y’all. There’s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can’t find it, keep looking. If there’s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we’ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it’ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

**EDIT (because y’all keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**

**My positions for this week: **

$135 3/19 TLT Puts

$65 3/19 ITB Puts

$95 3/19 VNQ Calls

**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**

**VNQ is my hedge if I’m wrong and yields fall.**

If yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that’s the whole fucking point of hedging.

*And no, those 3 positions aren’t my entire account. Even though I diversified, it’s only about a tenth of my portfolio. It’s very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there’s still a possibility you could be wrong. There’s no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it’s almost a for sure thing that you’re wrong. I’ve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*

Diversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y’all think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it’s important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. 

**Understand that stocks don’t move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** 

**Don’t complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I’ve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I’m making money.**

Understand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA’s ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you’re solving. 

Boomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We’re intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that’s why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.

I’ve been on WSB for years. This account has only been posting here for about a year and a half, but I had another Reddit i deleted when I was in the market for a new job. I know some of the OGs here will roast you for not taking the route of high risk high reward. It’s the culture that’s been here, and will always be here. Loss porn is funny, and gain porn makes you aroused. But both of those types of posts have a very important meaning behind it, and that’s to keep your feet on the ground, but your eyes to the stars. 

Per the words of Billy Joel on Vienna, 

“Dream big, but don’t imagine they all come true. When will you realize, Vienna waits for you.” 

That song has made huge impacts on almost every aspect of my life, especially investing.

For every person I see on here who have changed their entire life with the gains they’ve made, I’ve watched the same amount of people lose more than they could afford. I’ve watched newbies get burned bad and promise to themselves that they’ll never touch stocks again, and they don’t. I’ve watched newbies get burned so bad and become depressed, and their posts signal a call for help. I lost four close friends to suicide my final year of college in 2018. I don’t want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren’t worth the lows in the end. And more importantly, I want you to be able to continue investing throughout your life. Though, the dynamics and culture has changed quite a bit since 9m people joined, I welcome all of you to the group. Even if I miss what this subreddit used to be, I’m excited and optimistic about the future of WSB. If you’re eager to help this subreddit in any way possible, educate yourself on the market, the past/present/future global events and news, and do your own research that expands beyond the horizon of GME and AMC. Keep the shilling to a minimum, and back up all your posts with evidence. We’ve all been in group projects before. We know that it sucks when only one person does all the work, while the others run around like idiots. Strive to make this subreddit an effective group project, where everybody helps pull their own weight. And also, keep posting those dank memes and drinking your own piss. Group projects are worth it when the group gets fucked up together after the work is all finished.

Good luck on your journeys, my messages are always open for advice. Don’t come in asking where you should throw your money into, I won’t respond. But if you ask questions on what to study, and my thoughts on certain trade ideas, or if you need someone to talk to, I’ll respond. 

UPDATE: ITB puts are printing due to the NAHB confirming that home builders took a hit from yields rising (increasing mortgage rates) as well lumber inflation, which was my prediction

3250,DTCC rulemaking timeline + other sleep aids,m55mvf,"TL;DR the new DTCC rules for short sellers almost certainly aren't going into effect before March 19th--INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO SUBMIT A COMMENT ARE INCLUDED AT THE END.

I'm not a securities lawyer or SEC savant or even a particularly wrinkle-brained ape but I've read the DTCC proposed rules on liquidity requirements and short sellers and some affiliated communications and I think some WSB record-straightening is needed. 

First, a public comment period is almost always required for any federal rules changes. SEC or its affiliates may be exempt from this for some reason and I can't tell from the materials themselves so hopefully a smarter ape than me can offer comment. 

Until I hear otherwise, I'm going to assume that this is like every other federal rulemaking and the comment period is PUBLIC and will last 30 days minimum. I'm including directions for how to submit comments at the end pasted directly from DTCC's [IMPORTANT NOTICE](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf) on the proposed rule changes. If you have a strong opinion about these rules, the public comment period would be the time to voice it. 

**What's the actual timeline for the new rules?**

IMO the more important of the two rules (801) lists an implementation timeframe that can be found on page 19 of 79 of [the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf):

>*(v)  Implementation Timeframe*   
>  
>*NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice and approval of the related proposed rule change by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website*

NOTE: the ""related proposed rule"" is [SR-NSCC-2021-002](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf) and AFAIK has not been approved either.

I believe this passage is the source of the ""10 days"" timeline I have seen elsewhere. However, by my read this is saying two conditions must be met **before** the 10 business day countdown can  begin: (1) a ""no objection"" is filed associated with this rule AND (2) **SR-NSCC-2021-002** is also approved. 

Once both happen, that essentially gives everybody two weeks to prepare, make changes, etc. But before we start marking any close dates on the calendar, ask yourself: do I really think there will be \*no\* objection to this? 

To be clear, ""no objection"" is a term of art. Once again, I'm not a lawyer or SEC expert but I assume objections can come from the leaders at SEC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and presumably other federal political leaders including House and Senate financial services committees. The list of people who could object might also include, though I hope not, industry lobbyists or trade association heads. I don't know. Again, if you know this, please comment and I'll update.

**Why does this matter?**

I'm not a big fan of fixating on specific dates for things like short squeezes. The market is huge and complex and there are literally millions of people doing their part to influence it in lots of different ways. But if you've got dates in mind, and they're coming up soon, IMO you are safer and probably better off assuming this DTCC rulemaking process will not be complete and the new rules will not be in effect.

**How do I submit a comment?**

The DTCC Important Notice directs comments to SEC's Internet comment form here: [*http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml*](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)*.* When you click through though you'll see that's not actually a form but a list of SEC affiliated organizations. Ordinarily I would expect to find the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) proposed rules on the [NSCC proposed rule page](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm) but neither of these is listed there. So you may need to skip the SEC Internet comment form and go straight to ***sending an email to rule-comments@sec.gov.***

Here are the instructions for submitting a comment from DTCC's letter on [SR-NSCC-2021-002 & SR-NSCC-2021-801](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf):

This is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.

""BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1""

Well, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.

Now that the captain is gone, let's get to business.

[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https://preview.redd.it/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)

I know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  
What you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  
That was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.

Allrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.

Good boy/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.

Ok, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.

I hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  


I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  


[GME price action 22-27 January](https://preview.redd.it/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)

[GME price action 5-15 March](https://preview.redd.it/m1dydccm22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724902e12d23390a6f614fe026acd4f2c4abf3d)

Because they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.

97.9m\~ users WITHOUT including Robinhood. Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. ""China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month"" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)

*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|
|10|5|7.3m shares|
|10|10|14.6m shares|

&#x200B;

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

&#x200B;

[Source: https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.

Edit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.”

https://innovationandcreativityinstitute.com/stockdale-paradox/

>	“You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose —with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”
~ James Stockdale

Yeah it’s hokey, but those that assign a date to their “rescue” are going to be more likely to bail or break when that date comes and goes, even though they are just as sure it will come as someone who believes but doesn’t assign a date.

Do yourself a favor and believe your own conclusions (however you come to them), but don’t kid yourself with an exact date or range of dates. No one knows. And even if there’s the strongest evidence, there have been shenanigans in the past and they’ll come again.",1615763245.0

3545,"Melvin, Citadel, and Point 72 (GME)",m4vv5g,"I’m long on GME and enjoying this crazy ride with all of you fellow 🦍. Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I’m proud of you 💎 hands that held through Wednesday. 

I believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. 

In reviewing all the DD, I’m really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. 

1. I’ve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.

2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who’s teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn’t Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).

Again, I’m long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!

See y’all on the moon! I’ll be the guy in the mullet handing out wife beaters.

3641,GME: A game of Tug O' War,m4rbtc,"You vs the hedgies

If you pull hard enough you get 1000 banana, if they manage to get your grip loose and win, they get your 1 banana. Seems fair because risk vs reward of going against several opponents by yourself balances it out. But it doesn't, the hedgies are using every trick disposable to them to get you to loosen your grip; they let go of the rope for a bit and then let the big fat anchor hedgie pull as soon as you try to gain ground. Yet you do not falter.

Why? Because you are an ape. An ape knows they are not alone in this cause, they simply tighten their grip and HOLD onto their dear lives. The hedgies continue and continue but not a single whiff of your banana is in their grasp. Eventually after all their tricks, their pussy hands are bleeding- they cannot hold on anymore. You pull forward and one by one the hedgies fall and the 1000 bananas they owe are yours...

But you do not let go of the rope. No no, in fact you tighten your grip and HOLD and pull like you've never before. The hedgies have been screwing with you this whole time. All their dirty tricks, you want to make them pay. As you keep pulling the rope, and the last chungus of a hedgie falls, you notice that their rope does not end. In fact it is an endless rope full of bananas along the way. You pull and HOLD and pull and HOLD and you keep getting more and more bananas. 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, it just keeps going and going. Eventually you take your fill of bananas and decide to leave as a bananillionaire!

You were able to squeeze the hell out of the rope because you knew 1000 was not enough. Because you held, you got many, many more bananas than you thought was possible.

This is not financial advice, I simply like allegories.

3642,Forbes just published the DUMBEST and most dangerous article yet about the GME saga.,m4rbdw,"Here's the link: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson)

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

Here's the tweet they sent out: [Forbes on Twitter: ""Losing Touch With Reality – A GameStop Lesson https://t.co/msQlQleVqI"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1370993131592814601)

3653,PSA: Why You Shouldn't Buy Fractional Shares,m4qvtf,"Fractional shares are a recent trick brokerages have have used to entice people with small amounts of money to invest in the stock market. There are a couple reasons why you may not want to buy them:

(1) Fractional shares don't have voting rights. 

     You might ask, ""why should I give a shit?"" Well, for example, if you are invested in GME right now, there is an annual shareholders meeting coming in June and there will be very important measures that will be voted on then. Your vote, no matter how small, can have an effect on the company's future in the coming years. 

(2) You are giving instituions money to buy shares to loan out to hedge funds who want to short. 

    You heard that right. Fractional shares are backed by real shares held by some institution somewhere. You think they will let those shares sit there? Fuck no, they will loan them out so they can get that juicy 1% interest on money they didn't even put down in the first place. 

TL;DR: Buy a whole share if you can and exersice your shareholder rights and screw the 🩳

The obligatory I am not a financial advisor just an amateur crayon eater. 🖍

The following are some tickers I am watching come market open 3/15 thanks to finding some DD or conspiracy from some of my fellow autistic sex workers.

**NIO -** [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **go thank** u/jameskwonlee **for this**

* To be added to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April. If this is relative to other brands they could jump almost 100% in stock price over the months following the addition to that exchange.
* William Li met with Sinopec (second largest Oil Company and owner of 30,000+ gas stations) in early February. During NIO day William Li announced a second gen battery station. This potential partnership would create battery swap stations at a butt load of Sinopec gas stations. Huge ENERGY profits not just vehicle profits.
* PT at $60 from Mizuho and $70 from Deutsche Bank.
   * PLAY FOR LEAP CALL OPTIONS and simply more shares
   * $70-80 EOY Options
   * $50 short term summer calls seem pretty easy tendies as well

&#x200B;

**PLTR – why the fuck didn’t I buy sooner, might as well buy some fucking shares now**

* Stock is crazy hyped. Mainline that stimmy money plus Cathie Wood continuing to buy so why in the fuck have I been jerking off and not buying. My wife’s boyfriend is very disappointed in me.
   * Shares entry \~$25ish
   * Short Term Calls for YOLO sake

&#x200B;

**RKT – thanks to** u/bosshax **for his** [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**. This ape appreciated the photos**

* Still a huge short position in this company with many expecting another squeeze
* TD Ameritrade is not allowing for short positions of GME or RKT at this time so all the bears can get fucked
* THE FUCKING TICKER IS RKT!?!? 🚀🚀🚀
   * Shares entry \~$25
   * Short Term Calls are fucking cheap

&#x200B;

**UWMC –** u/itsguud [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0j402/uwmc_most_shorted_with_0_shorts_available/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **was the main thing that got my rocket started**

* Maybe the wholesale ultimatum doesn't mean shit to RKT but it at least seemed like some petty shit I was down with. Could be a big swing in price either way with those going into effect 3/15
* Being listed on new indexes on March 22
* Short interest seems to be ~~around 11%~~ **28% !!!!!!!**
   * Low entry price \~$9 a share so could have for a longer hold to see if anything pops

&#x200B;

**MVIS - intrigued from** u/mrbrightsied [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4mfm1/potential_inevitable_mvis_buyout/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

* Latest earnings call had the CEO talking about synergic alternatives including a sale of the company
* MVIS's LiDAR product is in MSFT's Hololens being hyped as the potential tech that allows for self-driving cars to be propelled to the forefront
* Jumped 40% last week in share price
* Bullish outlook on call pricing even 5 months out

Edit 1: going to bed now I’ll reply to any comments in the morning!

Edit 2: maybe not bed yet! I just got my first award what the heck. Maybe my wife’s boyfriend will let me sleep inside tonight!

Edit 3: Didn’t expect much of anything from this hack job of a write up compilation I performed! Thank you fellow mental patients, I might as well make this a weekly thing for all of you that can’t read.

Edit 4: Came home from work to more awards and MY FIRST SILVER!!! Thank you apes. Also the my post should now contain links to original DD. Great call out u/toydan

But while I have a rough mental estimate of the size of the WSB crowd, I have no sense of the number of institutional players. Recognizing that they’re all encrusted to their come-encrusted titties, how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting GME?

MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote “In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)

And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)

I’m not going to post any DD because there’s already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.

There’s been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft’s HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.

I’m posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you. I strongly believe in MVIS and think a buyout resulting in a huge jump in share price is coming. Good luck to all!

3793,"NIO - Bull-case investment Thesis, plus Crazy OG-style WSB ""Bet""",m4lj4s,"Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

**TLDR** \- I'll donate to charity if NIO’s passes $70 per share by April 16.",1615716963.0

I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.

Real quick:

* Not a pro
* Not investment advice
* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit

If you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.

Okay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.

# Theta

 The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. 

Theta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.

# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.

You dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)

 Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/br6wnmc31wm61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e4ca62032511a0b8e3ee2e43feed83b645def8)

# Theta will eat your lunch

Last week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...

# Retard/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here

You live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, ""**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**"" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.

This is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.

Do you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.

* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers / dog walkers / high school teachers
* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors
* If someone tells you they're not a pro/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.
* Read a book motherfucker

FD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  


Good luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read.",1615712928.0

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) .. This will help both those stocks if you feel like they are a good alternate investment. Time to cheer up the old fashioned way :)

Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.

But the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it. I am turning 25 on the 23rd (Daddy Cohen is gifting me an earnings report ☺) and even just 5k is a huge play on my part. Be smarter than me; be an autist.

God speed, retards.

P.S. Mad respect to the dude who convinced his girlfriend to tattoo her ass. That was hilarious.

P.P.S. not fixing typos; I am high on Xanax.

3977,"GME Technicals, DD, short interest",m4cka9,"This will be long apes so please bull with me. This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiet237zcum61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.

EDIT: I also wanted to add that though GME's rising price action could be considered ""crazy,"" it's market cap is honestly not crazy. People usually get caught up in the price but don't look at the actual market cap. GME's current marketcap is only about 18B. Is that overvalued for where the company sits at this current moment? YES. But, if GME makes a shift to the digital space and becomes the go-to for literally everything relating to gaming (and possibly gambling), then a 100 billion dollar market cap is very reasonable. This is why DFV likes the stock. I think that he was originally in it for the short squeeze, but now I think that he is truly in this company for the long run because of its potential, and I couldn't agree more! ",1615690157.0

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1j1f094h6um61.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=c000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

**His Reposnse to feedback:**

&#x200B;

>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

&#x200B;

>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can’t use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don’t delete 📷 I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\[14:02\]***\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think.

&#x200B;

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&#x200B;

>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

&#x200B;

3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me ""Fake News"" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the ""they cover instantly"" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Personally, as in u/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.

All we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

&#x200B;

In literally 10 minutes millions of shares became available for sale and hit every single bid-ask on the buy side. Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.

Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.

There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).

They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.

This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.

What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.

[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.

If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

**Important price 2: $300**They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350.

**Important price 3: $340.20**This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Important price 4: $350**Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400.

**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.

**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.

\*\*TLDR:\*\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want. Be prepared for the psychological games they will play. Remember NO SANE INVESTOR dumps shares at a loss or less of a profit...

Have a GREAT weekend!

**TLDR UPDATE: FAWCK I FORGOT ABOUT $420.69! LOTS OF IDIOTS WILL SELL HERE TOO**

4017,The incredible story being forged in the battle for $GME,m4avew,"This past week was incredible .... of course that’s on top of an already incredible story. 

DFV, Ryan Cohen, and many a smooth brained ape started this fight quite some time ago. Many doubted, but the momentum built and built until the huge spike at the end of January 2021. 

This first clash brought apes seeking opportunity, valuing GME, and of course those seeking to exploit the greedy HF’s who had overextended. As GME soared, new apes were drawn in. 

Then Melvin, citadel, RH, and other market manipulators did what they always do. Cheated. 

GME was soaring and apes were on their way to the moon. We all had our reasons for jumping in and why not?  Is it wrong to seek opportunity? Is retail not good enough to play the same game?

Apparently in the HF’s opinion we are all crayon eating bastards, it’s their game, and it only works if they make money. So they cheated, plummeted GME, and many apes were left floating in space. 

They didn’t care. They blamed retail. 

“Know what you’re investing in” 
“Meme stocks are volatile”
Distractions from where the real risk came from. Playing in a corrupt market with the facade of rules and structure. 

Sorry, but you can’t blame the apes who got left out there WHEN YOU CHANGED THE GAME! Trading halts that still allowed sells? What did you think would happen? If I’m an expert chess player and in the middle of the match the rules on how even a single piece can move are changed it puts me at risk! If I’m a retard, which i am, that just makes you even more pathetic that you can’t just play fair and beat me. 

There are many different apes in the GameStop game. Some of us have done years of research, DD, and like the stock. Others just came for tendies. 

Vlad called the initial swell a, “Black Swan Event”. Highly unlikely. 

Well Vlad, the Black Swan has returned. GameStop is again soaring. Over the past month it’s up 427%. And despite attempts to drive the price back down THE LINE HOLDS. 

This past week we saw some big moves. The battle intensified until Thursday and Friday where we fought to a standstill. Many apes were discouraged that the MOASS didn’t happen yesterday, myself included. Victory was within grasp. Pluto in our sights. But we are still in the trenches. 

But let’s not forget that GME is up 427% and holding! This is huge! We are making progress in a fight that was stacked heavily against us and we are holding!

Now stimmy’s are on the way. Hulu releases “Game Stopped” documentary this Monday. HF’s are bleeding money. 

This isn’t going to be easy and hasn’t been. But reinforcements are on the way. The HF’s are bleeding and all I have to do is HODL! I’m ready to got to Pluto and then some.  

I like the stock. I’m gonna build a house on it and stay here a while. Maybe forever. Doesn’t matter because that’s my smooth brained choice and the HF’s don’t get to tell me different. 

There’s a lot of dates being thrown around out there and maybe one of them is right. Doesn’t matter. I’ll be there when it happens cause I LIKE THE STOCK. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. IM RETARDED AND BRAIN WASHED. 

TL;DR 

I LIKE THE STOCK. VLAD SAID GME WAS ONE TIME EVENT. HERE WE ARE 1 MONTH LATER STILL UP 427%.  DFV IS NOT A CAT. NEW APES & STIMMY’S INBOUND. I CAN STAY RETARDED LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!

But, how much hype was there from consumers in the Oct-Dec range? Would we realistically reflect these gains on this next report, or will we not really see them until the Q1 report in three months?

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c

Since then

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**

Data from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

&#x200B;

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

I couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME / AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social–emotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

**Social Media help autistic children navigate the world***Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)

**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*“Participants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\* ***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.”***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

# ""Cool but it says ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences... so it could also mean you could paperhand?""

Well, not exactly...

**Emotional decision-making in autism spectrum disorder: the roles of interoception and alexithymia.** [^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)""*These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population,* ***emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD***\*.""\*

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy – even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

**Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as “You’re a star” as opposed to “Well done.”'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

**Autistic Traits Affect Reward Anticipation but not Reception**[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won’t react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

See you on the moon with unlimited crayons and video games.

4078,GME - option flow by the number - JUST HODL SMOOTH BRAINS,m47vi8,"**$GME - Option flow by the numbers**Aftermarket close yesterday I was feeling fried - not so much because of GME (-15k on tsla options woof). So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I’m an Old  Ape. I’m an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I’m an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I’m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn’t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.

&#x200B;

I used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.

&#x200B;

The Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)

.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.

There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)

On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.

So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That’s a lot of bananas. Like a lot.  


 **(( EDIT: $99,965,839 spent on these options. // Shorts/Hedge removed is 116,463,553 ))**  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That’s quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.  


**(( EDIT: -16,497,714 with adjustments to formula  still not sure how to account for IV / Vega / Theta in all of this))**

&#x200B;

Other information I like:65.2 million outstanding sharesshort float is 54.16 million cccording to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),short interest according to Morningstar is 52% . (**EDIT: updated to 26.22%)**

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**(( EDIT: -22,474,752 total shares to be covered after adjusting SI -))**

**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.

Go long, and stay strong

\*\*Positions:\*\*Was holding 365 shares, told wife i'd withdraw more money this weekend because she's sketched out as fuck about all of this (bigly bananas up for the year), down to 265 shares now.  with $30k in bananas to continue to add

- Go for a walk in the Forrest, woods or just around the city. (Depending on where you live)

- Feed the homeless 

- Talk to the Humane Society about volunteering

- Listen to your favorite music while on a drive 

- Call your mom/dad for a chat, they probably miss you

- Thank someone who helped you in the past

- If you were a paper handed boy, Donate some 
tendies to help your community. 

- If you are a Diamond Handed Man, donate some money to your community (GME will pay you back in the near future)

- Learn to knit

- Paint something, and it doesn’t even have to be good because “there’s no such things as mistakes, just happy accidents.”

- “Don’t forget to tell these special people in your life in your life just how special they are”

I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm  stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe to and  promote the notion that at current MC of \~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i  mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the  only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who  like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last  bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of  nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in  their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex  calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring  and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc.  etc.

\-  well you know what

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)

Market  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );

I  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more ""over-valued"" than some of the market ""darlings"" currently trading at considerable premium)

To  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

**TDLR**:  CEO of UWMC, who won Bball national championship with Michigan State,  went to war with RKT. RKT responded by buying naming rights for Michigan  State BB team. New name ""Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket  mortgage....

Alright so I have  been a long time holder of RKT and have played with UWMC. With Billions  being delayed I have more free time to watch real life.

**Step 1:** Mat Plays for Michigan State.

So  Mat was a walk on that made the team. Not that  there is anything wrong with that. He put in his dues, practiced against future NBA stars, and got himself a National Championship ring! So that is  sweet who does not want one of those. Mat is a loyal alumi and donates  lots of money. Link to his Forbes article on running his company like  Michigan st BBall [https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91)

Link to his 37M donation to Michigan State.[https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503](https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503)

**Step 2:** Dan Gilbert also goes to Michigan State....

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 3. Gauntlet is tossed down.**

Mat  hops on facebook live (looking high as hell... good for him) and tells  all his clients ""it us or them... ARE YOU ALL IN"" and has his clients  sign a contract that they will not deal with RKT. (None of my links will  post)

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with. It says "" Spartans presented by **Rocket Mortgage""**

Edit!!!! - Apparently they will not be fully named. https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2021/03/12/michigan-state-basketball-rocket-mortgage-sponsorship/4665634001/

“The sponsorship adds to a donation war between two of the nation’s leading lenders. Mat Ishbia, a former MSU basketball player who is the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, donated $32 million in February to the athletic department. Gilbert and his wife, Jennifer, gave $15 million to have a pavilion at Breslin named after them and contributed to the university’s Detroit Scholars Program and the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities in 2016”",1615640314.0

The 270C 3/12 was then quoted by the Forbes article on gamma swarm, Wednesday Night 3/10

G'damn degenerates piling into the 800C 3/12; Look, that far OTM have too low delta to trigger MMs forced buying. 🦍🦍🦍, is not every day you can trigger the gamma squeeze, some brokers are even actively trying to block it as seen by this post from an ape being blocked buying calls and puts by his broker of fear triggering a gamma squeeze.

>In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze????

They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX, but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME.

Looking at this graph, the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19

https://preview.redd.it/68ultrl34qm61.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fdcd61bd77cda27ed76e7f7b7e2a54aaf6e0c25

and with it the gamma amplification affect. With the 3/12 gone, that's almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there's still a chance for gamma.

I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don't know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.

The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.

Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY, she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\

^($GME IV Put/Call Inversion on long dated options) [^(https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx)](https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx)

According to her : ""blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it's trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. **so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is <50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts""**

I can't comment on the business transformation, I'm not an e-commerce expert, I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take \~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.

With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around \~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that's about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)

# TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.

**EDIT 3 : I see many 🦍🦍🦍 haven't grasped just how much power the gamma squeeze can contain.**

Buying 1 Contract of 270C 3/12 on Friday afternoon 3/5  or Monday morning 3/8, at the price of 3-5USD per contract(100 shares) / $ 300 with **6x initial delta amplification** would have resulted in **42x amplification**  value of shares delta hedged by MMs in Thursday or Friday open of about $13,000. Since the delta of the contract increased 0.12 to 0.49 and the share prices rose from 137 to 260-290 within that time.

4348,"There are more retail investors than ever, but we don’t have the power to tank markets.",m3wdhu,"I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual’s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely naïve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. 

I also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we’re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don’t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don’t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don’t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. 

There are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don’t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).

My point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you’re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. 

Three years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You’re telling me that these dumb hedgies can’t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. 

GME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. 

Think about it...their argument is don’t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It’s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally. They cant take that route because it would be planet of the apes part seven or some thing.",1615628523.0

There was an AI program predicting 100k+ full squeeze at 140% SI. This is the power of exponential growth - However this program is heavily extrapolated and doesn't take into account external factors such as Prisoners dilemma, there are also many probable flaws in the script.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c48lf6xt7pm61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a78f9b7ae232a35306788a436fd446eb673ddb23

 Let's do some simple maths (correct me if i'm wrong i'm trash at maths), We have a ""realistic SI of 600%, a difference of 460% or 4.6x) now lets interpolate the squeeze from January; $148 -> $347 -> $483 -> $1k+ (likely would've been higher), now lets extrapolate our current situation $265 -> $ 621.3 (\[347/148\]x265) -> $864.8 (\[483/347x621.3) -> $1790+ (\[1,000/483\]x864x8). Now lets take into account the 4.6x short interest - 1790x4.6 = $8234+. Take this with a grain of salt. This calculation (like the AI model) is heavily extrapolated and does not take into account the situations present during the squeeze in January such as the 9 figure volume that drove GME up + Gamma squeeze we may or may not have the same factors in the same squeeze today. However what I can say for certain is that this squeeze will be LARGER than the one in January due to real SI being 600+% (remember exponential growth - the higher the SI the even greater the price).",1615627834.0

Not financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.

This will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.

I mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.

Rule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?

The rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.

The list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).

Side note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.

Onto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? 

Unless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.

*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*

I know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?

The thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.

Fortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.

Oh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**

Put simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. 

It also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.

*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*

For instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. 

The rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. 

What I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. 

You'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.

Let's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. 

Pulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.

The rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.

TLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.

Edit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here",1615625343.0

This is a household name just like GME & AMC, shares have been beaten down to hell basically since IPO. This godforsaken stonk has barely seen double digits through most of its lifetime. That being said, everyone knows this brand. It was ahead of it’s time, but only for a very short time, when it came to camera quality and capabilities. As smartphones got better and better it started to deteriorate their sales as more could simply use their IFIN and Samscumb phone.

That brings us to the present. They are pivoting to a subscription model which has grown from new to 760,000 paid subscribers in approximately one years time since they pivoted their focus. This shit ass company’s market cap is only around 1.6B even after its present rally from $7 to around $11. Its short float is nothing great-approx 11% if this Google didn’t lie to this dumb retard, but that’s plenty to build on. This small cap target is the perfect candidate to diamond hand the hell out of and make a run towards Ape Heaven. GoPro has learned from their mistakes and focused on cutting costs while staying afloat. Now that we are REOPENING, this could end up being the perfect play as people begin to travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do that this ape wouldn’t touch. Per their last CC, they took a big hit with stores and travel being mostly closed as this product sells best in person. 

What day you apes!? Do you what to make a run at one of WallStreets most hated stonks of all time?! Is it time for this shitshow of a company to bloom? I don’t know shit about shit, but if we all agree on something then let it be so.

Many a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.

* Collusion!

No self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. 


My first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, ""you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for..."" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, ""Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special"" 


My second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. 


My third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. 


In conclusion


They are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.

4519,About March 19: Solid info & thrusters engaged,m3rqqf,"Boom ! now that I have the attention of you date worshiping slutty smooth brained noobie-boobie apes, listen up:

&#x200B;

 **TL;DR: Do not fucking hang on to dates and give others false hopes so they don't trigger the big red self destruct button when shit does not pan out they way you fucks fantasized.**

&#x200B;

Q: What is March 19 ? 

A: Quadruple Witching

&#x200B;

Q: Is it a guaranteed liftoff date and should you put your orders in for Lambos on 20 March ? 

A: No

&#x200B;

**Background:**

But why shouldn't we latch on to 19 March...

Well, imagine all the hedgies are in a circle formation and collectively walking this formation down the road. 

Q: What are they hiding in center of this formation and kicking down the road ?

A: A time bomb (shorted/counterfeit shares).

Now these hedgies are told, if they *leave the formation* (cover their positions) they will be *shot* (suffer huge losses) because when they leave the formation, the apes will be able to see the time bomb and become even more retarded.

Now each time one you retards throws a *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *card* (sell GME) a hedgie can pounce on it and run away from the time bomb.

**Problem:**

Now when you give the young apes false hopes of with these dates, they grab onto their tiny nuts and wait for the ""GMEday"". And when it turns out to be a <100% gain day; they freak out and throw *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *cards.* 

**Solution:**

HODL, that's right ! Just HODL. Trust the numbers and trust the process. There is no way these capping shitbags have covered their positions... read the DDs by apes with brains that have more wrinkles than mine.

4521,To anyone who invested significant life savings or taking out debt to go all in on GME,m3rqaq,"I went all in on gme last time and held from $40 to $105. This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a ""apes together strong"" meme or some dumb shit.  


The most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that ""its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell"", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.

TLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub. Don't bet your financial security on this.

Edit2: Btw I still own one share for the meme but would be totally fine if it lost 80% of its value",1615613602.0

The article is from May referring to the first stimulus.  

I think this should be bigger news with most Americans receiving $1,400 next week.  Some people mention it is priced in but an inflow of some significant part of  the stimulus checks ($400 billion) flowing into the market can't be priced in.  It isn't news - it is actual money hitting the market.

4524,Why just purchasing $800 calls isn't enough for 🚀,m3rmfv,"I've read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls, particularly high multiple calls. I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the 🚀 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options ""naked"" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.
This is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge.

I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.

  DiVeRsIfY!

Options are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it’s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It’s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you’re wrong, even if it is rare, you’re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.

Diversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, “Put all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.” He’s not wrong, but most people don’t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn’t know it. *We wouldn’t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you’re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can’t watch the basket very well.

Personally, I admit I don’t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That’s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don’t know what it is, but it sure isn’t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that’s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it’ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.

This play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing/trading.

## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It’s just money after all!

You are your main enemy to stock market success. It’s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you’re a person. You have emotions. You’re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you’ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone’s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you’re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.

I don’t really have a tip here because it’s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what’s happening and combat it.

## FOMO

Fear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it’ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that’s a great idea. You’re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that’s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it’ll keep going up at least until you sell.

Wrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \[redacted\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.

If you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can’t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don’t go crazy. Don’t “invest” anything more than you’re willing to lose. Using \[redacted\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \[redacted\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it’s stomachable, so invest that. I’m not buying \[redacted\] but if I did I’d be okay with a $500 ""investment."" If I lose it, it’s fine, and I won’t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.

## FUD/Dooming

The opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.

Then the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*

As before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say ""*don't panic sell!*"" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.

Like with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*

## No Regrets! No ""what ifs""!

There's few things worse than seeing an ""investment"" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the ""what if I just did this…"" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.

Then there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.

At least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.

My tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the ""what if"" thoughts that might haunt you.

The same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.

Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

4947,The most overvalued stock of 2021 - SEAS,m3kl1n,"A while ago /u/cyphonismus made an excellent DD on one of the most clearly overvalued stocks on the market: [Seaworld Overvalued - SEAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lry7dt/seaworld_overvalued_seas/)

(due to all the GME hype, it didn't get much attention)

&nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.

In other words, if take your 💩 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

""Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit."" -/u/ethandavid

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one 🌈🐻 position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxf7y0/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i/))

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it. 

**TL:DR** - short SEAS, use premium to buy more GME 🚀🚀🚀

4970,HERE IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE CRASH TWO DAYS AGO. WE HAVE STRONG POWER BEHIND.,m3kdud," this is my take. the drop two days ago was actually done by the longs instead of shorties. They did it on purpose to trigger short restriction just for today. If you look at the put volume for today, $250 for sure has one of the highest volume. That's why after the drop it went right back to $250 and has remained stable yesterday. TODAY WILL BE FUN. AND THE LONGS BEHIND US ARE SMART AND POWERFUL. I do think the fundamental has changed for GME. Thats why the longs have to clear the shorts for the future of GME. IF you compare market cap, revenue, cash, debt etc between GME and chewy. I DONT think market cap of GME should be any lower than chewy.

\>$200 of GME seems high compared to last year. BUT it's not at all. EVEN without short squeeze, I believe market cap of GME at least needs to double.

BTW, I think major longs are blackrock and JPM. GIVEN how blackrock supported Cohen.",1615593117.0

Look, let me put on my Qanon-brand tinfoil hat for a second.

Battle lines at 260. As soon as we crossed it, we started rocketing, shooting up to 350 when the, ahem, ""short ladder attack,"" occurred, dipping to below 200, then settling again near 260. Look at closing and AH prices. See: cat waiting to pounce tweet from DFV, indicating something significant we're watching/waiting for...? On the verge of? It's 25 secs long! On the cusp of the magical 26! (I said it was going to get Qanon-y.) Ryan Cohen tweet - shit's about to go down? Squeeze? Clogged toilets - i.e. fail-to-locate shares/liquidity issues?

Look at this:

https://twitter.com/incogni36140657/status/1370229679811141633?s=09

Also see the gathering storm at the battleground strikes, the OI in way-OTM  call options.

Ihor (S3 Partners) says the squeeze is still on.
MSM articles highlight the power of the gamma squeeze and options leverage, if you want confirmation bias of the power of retail.

Put all these things together and what do you get?

No, I'm asking. Seriously. Like, what does it all mean? I don't know, I eat crayons. I melt them into paste in my mouth and collect it in a jar to see what color it becomes. When we get a green day, I pour out a little into a cocktail glass as a reward a sip it like a fancy man.

 \*\*\*This Is Going To Be Epic!  [jlg.com/en/news-events/pres...](https://www.jlg.com/en/news-events/press-releases/2017/pdc-conexpo-mar8)  

\*\*\*Pay attention to the company names.   Las Vegas — March 8, 2017— JLG Industries, Inc., an Oshkosh Corporation company \[NYSE:OSK\] and a leading global manufacturer of aerial work platforms and telehandlers, announced plans to open its new parts distribution center (PDC) in Las Vegas later this month 

\*\*\*JLG is owned by OSK, the company awarded the USPS contract.  

\*\*\*Once again pay attention to company names.   [news.xpo.com/484/xpo-logist...](https://news.xpo.com/484/xpo-logistics-launches-aftermarket-parts-distribution-network-for-jlg/)   
   
 \*\*\*Now pay attention that DeJoy used to own XPO logistics and sold it but he kept a large part of XPO by giving it to his kids.  [citizensforethics.org/repor...](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/is-louis-dejoys-xpo-logistics-divestiture-a-sham/)  

DeJoy stills owns a lot of XPO that works with JLG which is part of OSK which was awarded the USPS contract by DeJoy.  There was a large $54 million block trade made in OSK the day before the contract award.

But more than video games, we want to see excellence and professionalism to give us something to aspire to, admire, and maybe want to beat.

What GameStop could be poised to deliver after the pandemic is a chain of not just game stores, but internet cafes, training venues for esports teams- amateur and professional, leagues, sponsorships, and televising rights.

Made me feel much more comfortable about risk vs potential reward and the once in a lifetime chance that this really is to stick it to the system.  Bought a bunch more at $46 finding myself at 100 shares at $114 average right before this last liftoff.  Bought 20 more for $185 during yesterday's dip. Seems I'm an expert now just like all of you.  Seriously though, I have learned tons from this group and so many things I didn't know before about this ridiculously rigged system.  No interest in selling any of it any more.  Feels weirdly comfortable.  I always was a paste guy, but now I like crayons too.",1615552454.0

Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

TL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares. Did I mention there's a 7% div?

&#x200B;

Postions:

* 4,225 shares
* July 15c, 17.5c, and 20c
* November 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25c
* January 2022 12c, 15c, 17c, 20c, 22c and 25/30c Debit Spreads
* January 2023 25/30c Debit Spreads

&#x200B;

Bonus Positons:

* JACKED TO THE TITS in PLTR shares
* PLTR April 16 35c at 3.21 Cost Average (FUCK)
* TAK January 2022 30/32c Debit Spreads
* WMT January 2022 165/170c Debit Spreads
* TSLA March 19 1050/1060c Debit Spreads at 1.25 Cost Average (ALSO FUCK)

&#x200B;

I'll see you fucks in tendie town.

Greetings fellow autists,

Firstly, I’d like to say how proud I am to be a part of this community.  I’ve been a redditor for almost a decade and this is by far the best group of apes I’ve ever had the privilege of calling my brothers and sisters.  I truly care about each and every one of you.  I’ve put a ridiculous amount of time in trying to determine how to personally navigate this journey and I’d like to share my findings with you.  Briefly about me:  I have an educational and corporate background in applied mathematics and engineering.  I am not a financial markets expert; however, I have a good amount of faith in my ability to analyze, understand, and manage risk.  Hopefully some of you find this to be helpful.

There are a two points that I’d like to address:

1. How I got comfortable with my plays.
2. The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis.

**How I got comfortable with my plays:**

Firstly, let’s make this clear: I am not wearing my investor’s hat right now.  I’m not diversifying or hedging in any way.  This is a calculated bet for me.  I think the risk is worth the potential rewards.  This is the opportunity of a lifetime; however, nothing is guaranteed and even if the MOASS were guaranteed, none of us know exactly when it will happen.  If I put money in that I could not afford to lose, I damn near guarantee that I would paper hands.  This would not only hurt my fellow apes, but it would also hurt me.  It’s a lot easier to diamond hands, or even just profit, when you’re truly fully prepared to lose everything that you put on the table.  It’s cliche, but scared money doesn’t make money...

I figured out an amount of money that could result in life changing gains, but that I’ll be okay with losing if things don’t pan out as I expect them.  Next step, how do I allocate that money?  Stocks vs call options.  My greedy side wanted to yolo the vast majority of my bet into deep out of the money call options.  My conservative side told me that I don’t really know when this rocket takes off, so I should be a bit careful.  The beauty in the stock is that I can sell it whenever I want.  The beauty in the options is their leverage.  I don’t want to get into the nuances of purchasing/evaluating options as that can be a series of posts on its own, but this is a fairly high level look at what I did:

I ended up putting approximately 50% of my bet into stocks.  I didn’t do this all at once, but spread my stock purchases out over a few week period.  I purchased a few options already near the money with expiration dates a month or so out (plot spoiler, they’re very much in the money now).  This gave me some time to see how things would develop and the ability to exercise them instead of just closing for a profit.  I also acquired options fairly far out of the money, with later expiration dates.  These comprise a small percentage of my investment \~ 10% or so, but also allow me to greatly capitalize if the rocket goes boom within my timeframe.  Finally I left a bit of money to continue with option (or stock) plays if this journey goes on for longer than initially expected.  Obviously we don’t all have the purchasing power to execute this sort of strategy, but hopefully some of it still applies to everyone.

**The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis:**

I’m not talking about engineered FUD.  I usually just laugh at that shit and move on.  That doesn’t phase me at all, if anything it strengthens my resolve.  What does bother me are posts that are positive and ostensibly sound, but fundamentally lacking in trustworth data and analysis.  I’ve seen a ton of posts with data/conclusions that are flat out incorrect, i.e. misconstruing short volume and short interest, not realizing that the data isn’t up to date, using data without understand the mechanisms behind it, etc.   As an example, when discussing the amount of shares left to short from iborrowdesk, no one seems to talk about what that actually means.  When/how are those shares replenished (meaning if there are only 150,000 shares left today, what does that actually mean for tomorrow or the next day)?  How long do the borrowers have to use said shares?  You get the point.

There are also posts using financial indicators or other metrics/features, comparing time series of graphs, etc.  Many of them draw conclusions that are just not correct.  There are so many different indicators/features and they do tell part of the story, but far from everything and especially not when used in isolation.  Accurately modeling financial data is difficult.  That doesn’t mean that I don’t think people should do it.  We should definitely do it, but we need to not only understand how to use these tools but also what they can tell us, if anything, and how to effectively communicate our findings to an audience with very different levels of experience.  It’s like this:  You work in construction.  You go onto a forum and see people talking about building houses.  Someone is like look: “Here’s a screwdriver, hammer, etc” this house will be easy to build.  You’d think that sounded ridiculous, right?  That’s how a lot of these posts sound.  Being excited is awesome, and believe me I’m fucking excited, but these posts are misleading a lot of people.  For people with little to no knowledge, they may be misled into making poor decisions.  For people in the know, they’re probably thinking: “wtf are these retards talking about?”  Both can ultimately lead people to lose their faith, and that is a very bad outcome.

tl;dr Have a fucking plan.  Think with your greedy and conservative hats.  Be extremely careful in giving credence to posts that say: “X will happen on Y date.”  DD posters: please, please, please do your fucking due diligence.  Question everything that you write.  Imagine that you are pitching a strategy to a bunch of really smart and nit-picky people that will question everything you say.  Break down everything.  Explore the nuances and tradeoffs at each point of your hypothesis, analysis, and conclusions.  With that being said,  I want to end this on a positive note.  I’m super fucking bullish on GME.  I believe that we will moon, but I don’t know when and neither does anyone else on here.

*obligatory: I eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice. if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here, expect to lose money. you have been warned.*

Looking at the recent market shenanigans, the price action, you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this ex-blockbuster-esque company that ***I*** intend to own, aaand the way short sellers / big fish / hedgies are using GME to engage in their pissing contests... I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks/months:

- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as ""Absolute Unfair Horseshit"" to ""Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground"" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was ""playing nice."" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.

- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.

- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).

- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.

tl;dr - Looks like it's just 💎🤚🦍s, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds / Whales now. Get ready for ""stagnation"" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.

Y'all win or I win. The only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers.

See y'all from the boardroom.

I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advice. This is purely my opinion. If you invest based on what I say alone, you are definitely retarded. 

If you have been following weed investing, you will notice that despite superior earnings and performance, US cannabis trades for less and in relatively low volume.  As of right now they cannot trade on any major exchange only OTC.  If what the CEO said in a recent report is correct, this may change very soon.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/marijuana/video/curaleaf-exec-expects-u-s-pot-companies-soon-to-uplist-on-major-exchanges~2157478 

Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close;

Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially.

(SOURCE)(https://ir.curaleaf.com/2021-03-09-Curaleaf-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-End-2020-Financial-and-Operational-Results#:~:text=Total%20Revenue%20for%20the%20fourth,of%202020%20increased%2026.2%25%20sequentially.)

This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US.  They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well.

(SOURCE)(https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/03/10/curaleaf-to-expand-to-europe-with-286-million-acquisition-eyes-eastern-europe-and-africa-next/?sh=5225bd621f04)

They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world.

One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking.  Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.

https://www.marketplace.org/2021/02/26/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks/

I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.

EDIT 1:  Some have pointed out $MSOS which is an ETF and you can trade options on.  I haven't fully looked into them but I think that any US based cannabis play is good.  My analysis up top I think points out why US based cannabis has a higher potential for explosive growth and a lot of the comments point it out as well.

EDIT 2:  $MO (Altria/Phillip Morris) owns logistics in this space and they already sell tabacco through multiple delivery methods.  They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends.  If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return.  MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends.  Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9).  With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive.  My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO.  I think $MO is the superior long play especially if they get out of debt.",1615541773.0

5541,"Large Scale Orders vs Price Action Today, 3/11",m362bc,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15gjchru0im61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=acc964b3d3e9a53edf1265b6ca5850e443ceeedf

First, I am not a financial advisor,  just an ape who has a fascination with crayons. And honestly, the first thing I saw when I  looked at this screen was a nice, big, tasty green crayon. After licking the phone screen a few times and realizing this was non-edible, I figured I would screen-shot this information to share with all of my crayon-loving ape-friends. Large-scale orders are indicative of institutional investing, so this gives us a tiny idea about what they're up to. Were institutions buying in?  Was Melvin trying to start to cover?  Was Melvin&co loading up on shares to sell off, short, profit from, hedge with, or what?

I then went back to stare at my lovely green crayon and noticed something quite distressing- *my crayon had shrunk!*

https://preview.redd.it/do6xms6w0im61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a4b00b08282cd6edac6a476d3761a5a3fb3c7de

After quickly checking my teeth for wax to ensure that I had not somehow managed to eat this green screen-crayon, I realized that the reason it shrunk was that large scale SELL orders had just increased from $18M to $24M  (see arrows).  My brain got a wrinkle- it itched- and then I decided to check the stock chart around the time these screens were taken.

[Vertical lines at approx the times screenshots were taken](https://preview.redd.it/hoiao15y0im61.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9ca7dd5c79255ebd470783a72f5176c3b284b6)

Would you lookie there.  A spike of sell volume all at once which drove the stock price down.  For a second, ape was confused... was it ""buy the peak and sell the dip!!"" or ""buy the dip and sell the peak!!""???  Ape was pretty sure dips were for buying, not selling.  My brain wrinkled again, it was annoying, and then I noticed this sell-off was ~~the low of the day~~ (stoopid monke) at a relative low-point around $260, seemingly trying to break the support level around $250.  But it held!  Stock slowly rose, ape got distracted, wandered away.  At market close, I decided to check on my crayon again....

https://preview.redd.it/66m5mwm11im61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cf1fc2077b840d93c42e88e2a536a5f82e734a

APE WAS DISTRESSED, and then I remembered that I can't eat this crayon, and calmed down.  I looked up and saw that large-scale sell orders had increased to almost $39M, meaning around $15M of large-scale selling happened since I last checked on my crayon.  My brain itched again, so I checked the stock's chart for the end of the day:

https://preview.redd.it/s67obl031im61.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=b994bf8589a3468e142dacc57e0ec88ba11180c8

Another spike in sell volume at around $260 which dropped the price to again test our support level  around $250.  Ape double-checked to make sure dips were for buying and  not selling- TRIPLE CHECKED- and confirmed, selling dips bad.  Then I  remembered that GME is on the short sale restriction list today, which means that Melvin cannot aggresively short the stock.  There's no rule, however, that prevents them from buying up a bunch of stock and then selling it off all at once, rapidly dropping the price of that stock.  Hmmm.... brain  is itchy.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really look like Melvin was buying up stocks to cover their short positions, it looks like someone bought them just to sell them off to screw with the stock price.  But that's just my crayon-eating hypothesis, who knows what the hell is going on.  🦍💎🙌",1615540883.0

5545,"EXPI crushed earnings, $70 share price inbound",m35usn,"I know most of you are a bit tied up on capital with GME at the moment, but for those of you who have some spare cash and are more value oriented, this DD is for you. 


**Background:**

I'm going to be talking about eXp World Holdings Inc ($EXPI). EXPI provides many products, but most notably their cloud brokerage firm, eXp realty. Per yahoo finance: ""eXp operates as a cloud-based real estate brokerage firm. It focuses on the development and use of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical brick and mortar offices and redundant staffing costs. The firm offers offers software subscriptions to customers to access its virtual reality software platform through VirBELA.""

The stock has seen a 52 week range of $3.26 - $90.00 and is currently sitting at $52.00 after hours post earnings (up ~13% on the day). Their market cap is right about 6B.


**Earnings:**

They absolutely crushed earnings, some notable details:

- Revenue increased 122% from Q4 2019 -> Q4 2020, with the result of a record high - $609.3 million
- 15% increase in agents and brokers on the platform in Q4 2020 compared to Q3
- A record annual net income of $31 million

**The juicy deets:**

Ok, so now we have the background and some numbers, let's see why this is such an attractive stock. The competitors of EXPI include players like; Redfin (RDFN) - 7.91B market cap and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) - 8.96B market cap.

Both of those are at least 1.5 billion more in market cap, with technology that is far behind what eXp is offering. Traditional real estate brokerages can't even be taken seriously when comparing, because they lack the technology side of things that EXPI offers. Hell, EXPI literally owns a VR platform for creating 3D virtual office environments. Which that part of their business is not even remotely being reflected in their stock price. 

It's more fair to compare EXPI to the tech startups that are upwards of 10B market cap. Looking at it from that perspective, we see a 4 billion dollar upside. Or a share price of ~$71.

That share price of $71 falls right into the 52 week range I stated at the beginning of the post and is what I consider an accurate value for this stock. The technical analysis from myself and others clearly shows this price target forming:

https://ibb.co/dL6brDg

https://ibb.co/Sx16QGx

RSI and MACD are both turning up after a long downtrend from the ATH (90 -> ~35). It found support around 40 and has bounced off of that up to $45 leading into earnings, which as stated before, were excellent. That caused the price to blow past the breakout area of ~51-52 during the AH session. 

This ship is headed for $70 very soon. It is certainly not going to be a GME type event where a 1500% return is seen, but a 40-50% gain on a company with good financials and future is something I certainly won't miss. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I just like the stock. 

Position: 61 shares @ $45

Edit: I've got a couple questions in comments and dm's about the bear case. Adding my take on this here. 

Bear case - 

Market writes them off as a traditional real estate brokerage, e.g. doesn't account for (or simply doesn't care about) the value add that EXPI brings to the table. In that case, EXPI is overvalued at $50 and true share price is around $30-$40. 

I highly disagree with that view point, obviously, but that's the perspective I'd take if I was in a short position.

They'll need to continue to show growth on their cloud platform(s) to invalidate the above thesis. This most recent earnings was a great example of them invalidating the short thesis by showing 15% growth on their cloud brokerage platform and record revenue numbers.

Double edit:

You beautiful autists who picked up shares and calls during the morning dips are true retards. Some of you are already looking at 100%+ gainz.

Triple edit:

Interest rate volatility is fucking us. I sold off at $59 for some quick gainz and bought back in at $46. Positions now are 20 shares @ ~$46 and 10 4/16 $60c @ 1.50 strike. I still stand by the thesis here, *unless there is a market wide correction due to interest rates.* Play anything in real estate / tech / growth very carefully right now.",1615540253.0

5590,GME Frequently Closing in Whole Number (Evidence of Manipulation through Statistical Analysis),m34tcc,"Recently, I started noticing something odd with GME's closing price. With yesterday closing at exactly $265 and today at exactly $260, I pull some historical price and went to town.

In the past 29 trading days, there were six closes resulted in whole numbers. These whole number closing days only started after **January 28th**, the day many brokers started placing restrictions on trading of meme stocks.

Going back two years in history, GME only closed in whole number **once** on October 23rd, 2020 at $15. In two years leading up to January 28th, 2021, the probability of close price resulting in whole number is 0.14%, it can be explained away as a random event.

However, 6 closes in 29 days is 20.7% in probability (>5%). You can no longer explain that with null hypothesis, that means **it was not random** and we are seeing a **statistically significant** event.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: GME's closing price is a clear indication that it is being manipulated. We knew so, but now statistics / science confirms it.

EDIT: Added graph comparing closing price vs volume vs date, with whole number closing days highlighted.

Do not let the highest highs and lowest lows consume you, stay in control. Many of those involved with $GME we’re burnt out after the initial chaos. In some ways they we’re lucky to recover an ounce of dopamine during the consolidation phase in Feb. But things are volatile once again (arguably also more defined) and the apes have something to live for once again. But understand the big players have vast resources to extend this course of history beyond what our feelings and intuitions can handle. Since the advent of the industrialized nation, that has always been the last yet most effective weapon in the arsenal of the powers that be - time. 

Admittedly, this ape doesn’t know much about stocks, but I do understand power. I can assure you they will drag this out in manners that DDs or financial experts cannot fully predict, within the market itself and from institutions outside of it. Prospect of tendies will be watered down and doubt will be sowed in the media and the mind of our ungrateful wives. Retail investors in $GME are playing a game of leverage with the Masters of Leveraging. And in this moment, it would seem the power of the many is outweighing the power of the few. Because of this, the rest of the world is rooting for you behind closed doors.

As it stands today, the stock has survived countless attacks from all sides. Victory seems afoot, hopes are high, and many can already taste the gourmet green crayons on their lips. But please remember that no matter your motivation, whether it be financial gain, vindictive positioning, revolutionary cause, or pure retardation, please do yourself and the stonK a favor and begin the process of accepting that you are playing the long(ish) game and it could be weeks or months before you finally get your dirty opposable thumbs on those earned tendies. And by god will we all have earned them all. If you begin to question the reason you started investing in $GME in the coming days, weeks, or months, you will fold and so will the stock. Many will be mocked, broken, homeless, divorced, suicidal, unemployed, and simply inconsolable. But the same person can also decide to beat their chest, nut the fuck up, continue to go about their life and hold/buy no matter how scary the dips are - and those same people will finally be praised, stable, prosperous, engaged, content, and most of all full blown retarded. 

Which way it goes depends on the decisions you make from now until then. During that time, many events will unfold undoubtedly... but you bet your sweet monkey ass I’ll still like the stock. Thanks to the early and controversial actions of the Burrys, Cohens, DFVs and now retail investors, the SHITers REALLY want that pen. I plan on making them pay for it, perhaps you should too.

**Update**
I don't have time for an EndGame part 7 dd. However I believe there are a number of catalysts leading up to earnings. 

1) Cohen as ceo 
Sherman's been ceo for exactly 2 years now. Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. 

Cohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can't sell easily as an insider). It's in sherman's best interests to get out and get liquid on what could be a billion dollar nest egg.

In 2019 Sherman was announced as CEO 5 days BEFORE earnings. 

2) Debt 
GMEs 2021 bond matures in 4 days. Potential credit rating impact. 

3) Potential 3/19 DTCC changes forcing brokers to force close short positions or at least shore up capital (could negatively impact longs as well, unsure here though)

4) IV will likely spike in calls just before earnings

5) cohen's tweeting 

All of this, while a squeeze is actively happening was enough to yolo some shares after hours and some calls tomorrow if we see a dip.",1615532405.0

5683,❓GME 📈& QQQ 📉last week,m32xw0,"The biggest story this month in mainstream finance media was the sudden spike in the interest rate for 10 year US government bonds and the effect it was having on the stock market. In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we’ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝***\*?\*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)

[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only >1% decline year in the S&P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go 📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

Now for some DD. Some crossover from [u/Shandowarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shandowarden) 


What is Root? 

Root is a car insurance company, but also a data technology SaaS company.  Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. 
There are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https://legiscan.com/OR/text/SB173/id/2236077) See [WA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&Year=2021&Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  

What does this mean? 

 Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. ""Doesn't progressive already do this?"" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.  

Alternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. 

Root has very little debt: $209M

And lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash / investments with its subsidiaries. This cash alone represents roughly 46% of the current ($2.8B) market cap. 

$LMND has a market cap of $6.3B (2/3rds of it's peak 3 months ago).  If $ROOT were to match that market cap of $6.3B (which arguably should be higher), we'd be looking around roughly $25 per share, let alone a short squeeze greater than GME... 

TLDR:  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  ROOT is a tech based insurance company also selling SaaS via data and telematics.  Data is transforming the world, and the insurance industry is incredibly behind.  Data companies such as this one will be here to stay, if not acquired by other insurance companies.

5704,GME - Fundamental analysis,m32kht,"OK, I know many of you don't know what fundamental analysis is, so go straight to the TLDR if you want.

Anyway, yesterday in another sub some people said $GME is just gambling while I argued it is also an investment, so I just want to recap main points:

&#x200B;

* Console supercycle: easy one, this should boost $GME revenue this year and probably next one if we compare it to previous cycles.
* Malls re-opening: easy also, Texas is now open and many states will re-open during the next months. Revenue boost also.
* Ryan Cohen: chairman, leading the business transformation, Chewy, etc.
* New business and product lines: gaming hardware, exclusive deals with Nintendo, Microsoft etc. Also GME followed Steam on Twitter and it seems they want to go big into the eSports. We will see in a few weeks how this plays out.

Many people said it is a company that is losing money so I looked into the financials and here is what I found...

Basic EPS went down to -7.23$ in 2018 according to Tradingview, so I looked into the cause. They had a huge unsual expense of 1 billion in 2018 and 400 million in 2019, so I went into the 10K of 2019 and apparently this was caused by goodwill impairment:

"" **In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess.** In fiscal 2019, we estimated the fair value of our United States segment by using a combination of the income approach and market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows, which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts, and requires significant assumptions including, among others, a discount rate and a terminal value. The market approach is based on the observed ratios of enterprise value to earnings of the Company and other comparable, publicly-traded companies. We recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $363.9 million and $970.7 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. See Note 7, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information. No goodwill impairment charges related to our continuing operations were recognized in fiscal 2017. ""

&#x200B;

And it continued:

&#x200B;

"" We have historically performed an impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired (see Note 1, ""Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies""). **During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we determined that a triggering event occurred as a result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization**; therefore, we performed an interim impairment test for our goodwill. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $363.9 million related to our United States segment. We have no remaining goodwill as a result of the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $970.7 million related to our continuing operations. No goodwill impairment charges related to continuing operations were recognized in fiscal 2017. ""

So if I am interpreting this correctly, losses are not caused by business operations, but by accounting policies (FASB). So because market cap declined and revenue declined they recognised goodwill impairment and that made the net income go negative.

So looking more into another metric, operating income it was +310 million in 2018 and +45 million in 2019 and -175 million in 2020 (TTM) according to tradingview. Gross profit and revenue also declined. So yes you could think ""it is a dead business"", but maybe not. 2020 losses could be explained due to the lockdowns which killed brick and mortar, so main thing here is declining revenue and a business model that is not sustainable...

Meet Ryan Cohen, who make Chewy revenue grow 500% from 2016 to 2019, while growing gross profit around 1000%. Let's say he can grow revenue 100% in the next 4 years in $GME (I think it is a modest assumption), this would mean $GME revenue would grow to around 12 billion, gross profit would expand probably to around 4-5 billion. Substract operating expenses of 1.8 billion taking 2019 numbers and you have a business with 2-3 billion in operating income.

Now if I am correct when interpreting financial statements, this would wipe out the goodwill impairment, therefore making the company profitable and with EPS that could range from 5 to 10$ and that could even pay a dividend.

Now put a PE ratio of 40 (sp500 is around that) and you have a 200$ to 400$ stock.

Of course my thesis could be wrong. Do your due dilligence. Not financial advice.

&#x200B;

TLDR: If Cohen makes the revenue grow, $GME could be back to profitability and with current sp500 pe ratio, price could be on the hundreds.

HFs (and the rest of the world) have discovered that people want to squeeze them and are willing to take huge bets on options and buy meme stonks at outrageous prices. They know that people feed on hype even at the expense of their live savings, with desire to get rich and stick it to the man.

So, knowing this, how can they protect themselves and scalp retail out of millions?

Step 1: Buy meme stonks at low cost basis
- this causes a huge price uptick and draws attention from  retailers, sucking them in on FOMO and greed.
- this also allows them to cover a heavy amount of short positions at the price they bought it at if necessary. Not at $100,420.69

Step 2: Buy more meme stonks. Start a new hype craze by the rapid upward price.
- they are still buying it for less than retailers because they know retailers will FOMO in.

Step 3: Once the IV is through the fuckin roof, sell tons of options.

Step 4: Establish a new high short position. They control the peak because they were the whales largely responsible for driving it up.

Step 5: Dump a ton of shares and tank the price. We saw this on Wednesday. Once sold down to a sizeable delta, they then close out on short positions established at their peak. We have data showing 900,000 shares become available to short right after the price ""recovery"". Which means someone covered a fuckton of short shares.

Step 6: Control price til option expiry. They want the price to go sideways until all of their written options expire OTM.

Step 7: Repeat.

They are in no short squeeze danger because they own a ton of the float. There is no one driving the price up but themselves and the weak collective of retail hooked in.

 The real threats to them would be the following:
1) The rest of the world jumping in and actually throwing in enough capital to squeeze them to a margin call
2) Retail selling EVERYTHING before they do.
3) a whale bigger than them wanting to get into this game.

They know the first two likely won't happen. They influence the media to help ensure the first one. They count on retail fomo and diamond handing to not worry about the second option. The third option likely hasn't happened because most institutions with billions of capital probably don't want to risk it going to war with other MAJOR HFs. Keep in mind Citadel is backing Melvin and has a retarded amount of capital. Who wants to risky their own ass to support retail and F with those other big players? And also risk SEC investigations. No, those whales are staying away.

So. Ask yourself, is diamond handing and FDing options the right play? Or is retail just being dragged through the mud and diamond handing actually their downfall?

Some lucky individuals will cash out some profits, but likely at the expense of other retailers.

This is what I believe is happening. And my guess to confirm my suspicions is that we see this price continue to go sideways through tomorrow so all the 3/12 expirys can fall OTM.

They may repeat the process next week, or dump everything they own right before QW, either way I don't see them leaving themselves wide open to be F'd by retailers.

First,  I am not a financial advisor, just an autistic ape with a fascination with crayons. And honestly, the first thing I saw when I looked at these screens was a nice, big, tasty green crayon. After licking the phone screen a few times and realizing this was non-edible, I figured I would share this information with all of my crayon-loving ape friends.

So large-scale orders are indicative of institutional investing. This means.... a) big money is starting to load up on GME, b) Melvin is loading up on GME so they can execute another large short attack, or c) a bit of both. Obviously, I like “c” the best (it stands for crayons). What other apes think?? 🦧🙌💎

UPDATE: at 2:26 eastern, large-scale orders now at +$15.48M

UPDATE: as of closing, large-scale orders now at +$8.6M.

Full disclosure. I own stocks in GME and other stocks. But I never bet more money than I can afford to lose. If I buy a dip, I’m putting small amounts in, that won’t affect me if I lose it. 

I have seen family members lose mortgages over gambling. I have seen relationships break down, so I feel obliged to share this.

This year has been wild for market volatility. It’s very tempting to put more money in than ever in order to see big return.
However, please consider these questions:
-Do you bet more than you can afford to lose?
-Do you need to gamble with larger amounts of money to get the same feeling?
- Have you tried to win back money you have lost (chasing losses)?
-Have you borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble?
-Have you wondered whether you have a problem with gambling?
-Has your gambling caused you any health problems, including feelings of stress or anxiety?
-Have other people criticised your betting or told you that you had a gambling problem (regardless of whether or not you thought it was true)?
-Has your gambling caused any financial problems for you or your household?
-Have you ever felt guilty about the way you gamble or what happens when you gamble?

Score 0 for each time you answer ""never""
Score 1 for each time you answer ""sometimes""
Score 2 for each time you answer ""most of the time""
Score 3 for each time you answer ""almost always""

If your total score is 8 or higher, you may be a problem gambler.

Just a PSA. If you feel like you are developing a gambling addiction, please don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. 
Depression and gambling addiction are real.

6082,GME $250 range likely pinned until EOW (hope my monumental retardation proves me to be wrong again),m2vz6q,"Welp, I hope I’m wrong again like I was yesterday. Good news/bad news below 👇🏼

Before the massive short dump, the biggest gamma position yesterday was the $800 strike call option expiring Friday, up from the $100 strike as of Monday, which is partly why I thought the low yesterday would be $300, I thought we were well on the way to a gamma squeeze the likes of which would dwarf the January move. Then the Texas sized short dump showed up...

Still, in terms of single strike options, the $800 is the biggest position which grew massively yesterday. 

Bad news is, the gamma position that grew even more (I’m guessing this happened mostly before the giant dump) is the $250 strike position mostly on the put side but also on the call side, the $250 strike gamma position makes up about 60% of total gamma open interest right now, so it looks like they’ve pinned us at the $250 range until EOW. 

Good news is: call open interest is still getting extra gamma squeezy and after tomorrow’s expiration the vast majority of gamma open interest is huge call volume so next week we can expect major upside movement to continue (depending of course on how much manipulation we might see)",1615513276.0

&#x200B;

So now let's take a look at the heatmap for today.

&#x200B;

I check these everyday and throughout the whole week for all my plays. I had not seen anywhere near that many puts these last couple weeks. And of course that day we saw what happened. I wish I would have checked what the heatmap looked like on AMC and other stocks we saw take a massive dip. To see if this was all a master plan by some whales.

Regardless we can expect today to be a good day for GME. Keep HOLDING. Any other insight would be very much appreciated.

# What happened to the high short interest?

The author claims it's largely gone.  The short sellers did cover most of their positions (140% SI is now 50% maybe, the author claims 30%). I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise (like 200%-900%) are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.

(Edit: Even if SI is in fact high, this doesn't contradict the theory)

# So GME is fucked if SI is low?

**Not at all.** There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging. He's calling it a ""gamma swarm"" and it works like this:

# Call sellers are going short, but not for long

When you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised. That's it. If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.

But what if it goes up? Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract. With American calls this can happen at any time. With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date. That's the gamble when you sell call options.

Big players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.** That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares. This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract. Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell 🚀 calls to 🦍 (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left. So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.

# How long do they wait?

For GME? 1-5 minutes. That's wild.

# How does this impact GME?

At the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10. That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.

Now, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares. Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares. So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.

# So, ultimately, what's happening?

The author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:

""This leverage has changed the game. It will be “interesting” to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have.""

""\[T\]his new surge suggests that other companies with different shareholding profiles could be vulnerable. Factors such as size or liquidity could be important. We probably don't know yet what the risk factors are.""

""With the “Gamma swarms” the process has suddenly become violent. The “Gamestonk” rout accomplished *in three hours* what it took the engineers of the legendary Volkwagen short squeeze *three long years* to execute.""

6170,Short selling explained easy,m2uais,"I see a lot of posts asking what short selling is so i tried to explain it with an simple example.

You have 50€ on your bank account.
Your friend just bought the new FIFA2021 game.
Then he decides to borrow it to you for 3 Months because he doesn't needs the game at the Moment. 
You take take the game and say thank you and give him a litte gift and promise him to give it back in 3 Months.

Then you take the game and sell it for 50€ on Ebay because you think the price for the game will decrease over time because Fifa is a game which will be bought less over Time because there will (or maybe already is) a better game (Fifa2022) soon.
You now have 100€ on your bank account.
After 2½ Months you buy the game back for 30€
You now have 70€ on your bank account. You made 20€ Profit.

This is short selling explained in a very easy way.

Lets go back to the scenario when you sold the game.

Suddenly a lot of people start buying the game. Maybe something makes the games special (maybe a printing mistake on the cover) or some random people in the internet say: lets buy every existing FIFA2021 game.
The price for the game starts rising. 
60€
80€
95€
You see that and think: Shit I have to buy the game now otherwise it may be possible that I can't give back the game in 3 Months I only have 100€. 
So you buy the game for 95€ in order to be able to give back the game.
Because you just bought the game the Price increases to 100€ which causes that the next dude who sold the game of his friend has to buy the game. The price will increase till everyone who sold a game which he doesn't own bought one back. 

You now have 5€ on your bank account. You have lost 45€ and the people who sold the game on ebay made 45€ if they bought the game for 50€

This is a short squeeze explained in a very easy way.

Metaphors explained:

FIFA2021=Highly shorted Stocks like GME
You = Companies like Melvin Captial
Your friend = People who borrow Stocks to other companies.
eBay = The Stock exchange
Something that makes the game special = E.g. a new groundbreaking announcement from a company 
Some random people in the internet = r/wsb

I hope i explained everything right. Im not an financial advisor but this is how I understand whats going on at the moment.

Correct me if im wrong. Ask questions if you don't understand something

6339,"What the GME Gamma Squeeze needs to keep going, and why it will probably run out of fuel.",m2rxyz,"These are my thoughts on a very solid article on the GME gamma squeeze which fits the available data well and shows a reasonable case for both correlation and causation between OTM call option buying and the stock price movements. It can be found here and has been doing the rounds on WSB:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=7314f9ff4225](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=7314f9ff4225)

To be fair, only apes, bagholders or the very inexperienced actually believed the reason was a short squeeze. You can't tell them that though no matter what evidence is given to the contrary. The gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility.

Here are a couple of other thoughts I had while reading the article that support a very bearish case:

&#x200B;

1. **A gamma squeeze needs at      least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising:**

**a)** People buying OTM calls in very large volumes

**b)** The stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock (or calls themselves, of different delta's and expiry's ) to re-hedge.

There are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions don't occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends - remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment - as it's clearly not fundamentals (it's a 15-25$ stock) or a short squeeze.

**Here the issues with condition a)**

Looking at the ATM weekly call 250$, expiring March 19, we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 (75$) giving a breakeven price at expiry ( not paying any attention to the other greeks. which given the theta decay and possible IV movements will hurt the buyer) of $325.

The 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ (4700$)giving a break even price of 397$.

Now, the problem with this is simple: These very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford, even those well OTM. **Usually the retards might be able to afford a short term (weekly) OTM lottery ticket type option that you see yolo'ed here on WSB all the time, but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium (implied volatility) , the vast majority of apes are well priced out - a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys.**

In addition, IV has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days AND earnings is just two weeks away. IV typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings, so these calls will become even more expensive (even if no share price drop occurs). Ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of it's own success.

**Here are the issues with condition b)**

Of course, the share price is pretty volatile day to day so I'm not going to try to predict it, but I would note a couple of important points:

\- The share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze (see article) and once people realize this many who don't understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon. The holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or 'buying the dip"" (retailers volume is estimated to be around 1/10th of institutions/MM's/quant funds/ hedgies, most days at least) makes no difference - this isn't a short squeeze after all. Additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will ( see yesterdays 40% drop in 20 minutes) to suit their needs, and we don't know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock (short term algos) and so on. Maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls, but if they hold puts they will want it down. We simply don't know for sure, other than to note the current open interest put/call ratio is around 3:1 - or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls.

More importantly for the share price to 'gamma squeeze' you NEED condition a) to be fulfilled. It is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy OTM calls on mass. This is not happening anymore.

\- Secondly, the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers (who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral) re-hedging their position. Again this poses massive risks for bulls, as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop. As the price drops those OTM and ATM calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value. Now if the price drops enough ( as an example if you bought just before the halt that ATM weekly (250 strike) call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$, a massive loss) the market makers will begin to re-hedge their risk in any of these ways:

\- Buy the call back for a significant discount ( or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay). This means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises.

\- Buy the now other (now) much cheaper calls\* to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge

Now, I've kind of skipped over the details here, but this is the essence of what should/could happen. Now of course, those calls\* themselves that are used to re-hedge will also have to be re-hedged by other market makers, but usually it's much cheaper to re-hedge a suddenly OTM call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta - it requires less purchase of the underlying. **So basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction - as the price drops, the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares, and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues.** It has similarities ( but is NOT the same -I'm not saying that at all) to a gamma squeeze, except now it's reversed, and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldn't be as violent. This is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited (stock price can moon indefinitely - in theory) and thus are riskier for market makers, but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0.

**TLDR:**

Bulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze can't be sustained. This is due to market makers re-hedging ATM/OTM sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price.

Whatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly (hours/days) especially once people realize what is going on.

**Positions:**

Tons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expiry's 23-43 days out.

**Edit**: A helpful person mentioned that I should have explicitly stated that you need **both extremely bullish ITM and OTM** call option activity to create a gamma squeeze. I totally agree and should have mentioned that.",1615503274.0

6515,The De-levering of Citadel and Melvin Capital via $EXPE,m2oxn9,"It has become apparent through recent events that the fate of Citadel and Melvin Capital are inextricably linked.  One might even say Melvin Capital is a thinly veiled shell company for Citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure.  

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.  

https://preview.redd.it/uxctj2oi2em61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=378c368c44c2dc85abff6ba29ba59697ca6f3176

&#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",1615494218.0

Someone made a shit ton of money from the drop.

So as most of you know a good deal of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying rolling forward as the price climbs, and subsequent MM delta hedging.

Someone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock. They then sold their puts off at the bottom. As you can see the put volume spikes are identical.

Position: shares and calls in $GME

**TLDR:** watch out for put volume spikes at the bottom of run ups if you took a loan out from your wife's boyfriend to buy $GME.

So down a shot of hedgie tears and be entertained by my weird thought process. 

For decades the avid retail investor has looked to an authority for trading advice, whether it be the News or a ‘financial advisor’. They took shelter under their DD thinking they knew what they were talking about only to end up in the red or make a 5% gain which they called a win.

But in recent years as social media rose to be king there has been a shift in who investors have deemed the authority. News lost its audience and they started taking sides offering airtime to greedy folk who saw an opportunity to trick investors into thinking they were there for the little guy. \[Be careful of rich celebs who take our sides as they could be playing both sides\]

Why am I bringing this up? Well look around, here we are on a subreddit reading DD by anonymous investors and taking their word over those we can see on the television.

What does that tell me? The avid retail investor has little to no trust the MSM are talking in their best interests. They’ve taken on their authoritarian position and assumed they were the Gods of stocks and could move money better than the hedgies could. How wrong they were.

They’ve come to the realisation they are losing and now out to make an example of those pesky retail investors who ignored their calls to sell but instead bought the dip and/or held. They want them to lose so bad to prove they were just gamblers who are trying to manipulate the market. \[Total bullshit - we like the stock\]

I won’t go into detail here cause we’ve seen it being plastered all over the subreddits. - The MSM lying.

So where am I going with this? 

People today are the new model of stock trading, the behaviours are not the same as boomers. They hold when told to sell \[by the MSM\]. The DD is comprehensive and detailed beyond basic understanding. Reasons are explained and any stock boomer lingo like shorting, buying calls or puts is explained for any simple ape to understand. So not only is the average retail investor learning how the market works at a rapid pace but now knows what signs to look for when they’re looking into a stock. 

GME has taught many how to react when the market is rigged. The talk of Diamond hands has not only been taught but is now in the process of forming how the retail investor behaves in a declining market when the boomers would paper hand and cut their loses. 

We’re entering a new era where retail investors are far more educated, the stock market lingo is broken to simple explanations making it easier for new investors to get up to speed. We find humour in an otherwise boring world filled with green, red and numbers. Not only is the retail market growing but it’ll become the strongest backbone. When red comes there won’t be big sell orders. They’ll simply buy the dip and ride it out. The money made won’t be out of greed, it’s made out of the want for a better more comfortable life. The taxes will \[hopefully\] go towards improving their society and fuel the economy for decades to come.

Change is coming and it’s for the good. 

TLDR: Hedgies and the MSM are going to lose to a bunch of retail investors called apes who can just about read, eat bananas and snort crayons for entertainment and can’t find the sell button.",1615492330.0

6589,Short interest: Enough for GME?,m2nebm,"Today I noticed an article from [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-stock-on-a-roller-coaster-once-again-as-short-interest-drops-193227331.html) stating that short interest has decreased. They list S3 Partners as a source for this [image](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MkVXMG96ehZmCECEATNvvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/7e513340-81d5-11eb-bb7b-a10ddb84ae91). 

S3 Partners is a FinTech company who measure short interest. Seems all solid until I found the twitter of S3 partners retweeting a tweet that GME is one of the most 'squeezable' stocks at this moment. The tweet was posted 21 hours ago, so that could still mean it has decreased afterwards. 

I stumbled on the account of Ihor Dusaniwsky, Managing Director of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners. I cannot confirm at this moment if this is his real twitter account, but it seems to be legit. 10 hours ago, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1369795438304501760): ""$GME is still in a moderate short squeeze as shorts continue to slowly close their positions, I still see it as a short sqeeuze candidate""

Now these two things seem to contradict each other, or am I reading this wrong? Did short interest decrease but not enough to not have a short squeeze happen? Is Yahoo Finance quoting the wrong numbers since the managing director of S3 tweeted there is still enough interest?

6610,What is High Frequency Trading (HFT) and what does it do to stocks? [Explained],m2n1ul,"First of all I have to congratulate to all apes that hold this attractive stock with their diamond hands, and shoutout to everyone who even bought the rediculous dip that we all witnessed yesterday (10th).  
So I want to explain what HFT is and how the ultra rich use it.   
Some of you might be too young to witness and some heard of these mega bubbles like the ""dotcom bubble"" 2000 and the ""real estate bubble"" 2007-08.   
You might have heard about the movies of Wall Street, Margin Call or Boiler Room that are based on the events that happened before.

Lets get this straight. Market Manipulation has always been a part of the stockmarket. Such as insider buying or selling with large orders.(For that you could as a normal trader find still a way to be profitable) but with internet and technology that just got better and better over time, the softwares with High Frequency Computer Trading/Algorithm have changed this market manipulation that we see today.   
So what is this software?  
Such software is capable of doing trades in milliseconds. They are used to drive stocks up rediculously high or down. It gives the people that are watching this an optical illusion that a stock is being bought with momentum or sold with force. So good luck being a technical trader.

By selling stocks as soon as they buy them, the HFT is manipulating price differences.  
Faster trades = more money  
In HFT it doesnt matter how much money is moving in each direction per trade, its the amount of trades the program can make in a split second thats important.

So if you can make like 10.000 trades every second and arbitrage 0.0001 cents per trade, thats 1$ every second.  60$ every minute and 3600$ every hour.  


And then there is fake news. If someone decides to create panic, they simply make some news. Post it. ""Ape stuck in Bananaprocessing machine, production halted"". And as soon as this is posted, the stock of your BananaCompany that you have invested in, has dropped before you could even react onto it.

And who loses money? The normal investors. Mostly retailers. So if anyone talks that a retailer is able to manipulate a market while these big boys have 70-80% power over it, thats fake news.

We can prolly give it momentum, but that's all. 

But the real battle is between the bigboys themselves. Because each one of them has such a machine, and it must be better than the other, in order to win.   
So what these programs are designed to do apart from making trades in milliseconds, they also FAKE in milliseconds.  The Trade orders are sent  to throw a kink into competing programs. Many trades are just made to flood the market and trick other computers+investors into thinking that a trend may be occurring in a particular stock, when no trend really exists.

So these programs are made to read feeds and analyze data, but they cant varify wether this data is true or not. So wether the ape stuck in bananamachine and the production is halted news is true or not, the stock will fall because the bot reads it. The same way when you play an online game, the program cannot see and decide wether you are sabotaging the game or you are just bad af. But if you for example write some words, especially negative, they immediatly strike you with a ban.

How do we know we are in a bubble? When you make cash easy. And the bubble grows exponentially higher when these bots are included aswell. And why will the stockmarket crash? Because of easy money. 

So some should consider after this bubble bursts, that trading might not be the same again. Then we talk about a bearish market. And as normal  trader it is impossible to beat the market. If you wanna invest, invest in a company that you believe in a longterm growth. GME will be one of a kind thing. Things will change after that.",1615486484.0

6778,GE might be doing a 1:8 reverse stock split,m2j3z8,"Here’s an article about it:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

6810,Discussing about Forbes article and possible gamma squeeze retaliation,m2ijoe,"If you haven't read that Forbes article that came out today, you should. It's really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this GME growth, and why it will continue: www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/

However, it also gave me an idea of what happened today and I want some feedback on the theoretical, and thoughts on why they wouldn't just keep doing this.

The article describes the price rise driven by the need for MM to cover calls. If they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock, that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered. After two weeks of heavy call volume, they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print. Let's say they're average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250.

I don't understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose, so apologies if I'm drifting off base.

So if I'm sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and I know I can't stop the increasing price, why not flood the market with those million shares I have so the price plummets, and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering ITM calls? It would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls... Charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount.

So in this scenario, they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300, banking that $25 premium, but since they NEED those shares for delivery, and aren't willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed, they buy them back at an average of $225, $25 less than the average call strike.

They net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls. If they're smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis.

So... Can someone tell me why this wouldn't work? Or why it's probably not what happened. Because I'm sitting here, after the fact, thinking to myself, ""if I was an evil fuck, with loads of money to push shit around, and I don't want to lose  any of it, what would I do?"" And this is exactly what I would do.

And if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened, what's to stop them from doing it every week? I know it doesn't hurt us financially (just psychologically) if we hold through it, but it will eventually scare more and more people away. What's the recourse? Anyone care to weigh in?",1615468730.0

DTC is coming 8-60 days all depends if the sec submits a rebuttal. That is a GAME CHANGER FOR AMC.

Go ... go to the movies . Nothing good playing ? Our money is playing. Watch a cartoon dragon, watch a silly love story, watch a car get blown up. Get out to the AMC movies!!! Common sense.

GME steadily has been producing some great gains this week, opening Monday bright and early at 154.89 and finally opening today at 269, looking poised to make our moonshot. Unfortunately, after peaking above 330, after a series of trading halts, plummeted down to 198, with restabilization by EOD.

To the unexperienced eye and paper hands, this looks like a time to sell.

The Sockeye Salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway. It begins as a massive dip that goes below red (to match the color of breeding Sockeye), then some wacky shit for the ventral fin, and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish, in the green for approaching the head.

# But what about the natural predator of salmon coming to spawn?

&#x200B;

[That’s right, gay bears are behind this shit.](https://i.redd.it/4qpbtglkpbm61.gif)

Bears the natural antithesis of salmon, and gay bears the antithesis of the retail traders. But how have the gay bears forced the stock to plummet? What manipulation did they have this time?

# You may be familiar to ladder attacks, but let me introduce you to fish ladder attacks.

# 

[This is a fish ladder for the uninitiated ](https://preview.redd.it/wxxih8reqbm61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=472de53d1dbb29bbe51b2c971242a4f098859d6f)

Ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth, despite hedge funds preventing direct, uninhibited access.

# Hedgefunds have stationed gay bears at the ladders to eat the incoming paperhanded salmon, which was the primary driver in today’s major crash.

# But what’s that tube representing retail trading?

# Thats right, its salmon tube time

&#x200B;

[But who’s loading the salmon?](https://i.redd.it/5z7cp28ktbm61.gif)

# Diamond hands, Ryan Cohen and other big players are literally loading willing salmon into the tube to bypass the gaybears and fish ladder attacks, to take us straight to valhalla for our tendie spawn.

6903,Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k,m2h4zy,"While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, ""Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower."" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀.",1615463398.0

>Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in ***GME $270 call options for Friday March 12.*** The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.

>***A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share***. It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk. They would have covered, hedged, by purchasing shares – adding to the surge.

6981,The Theories on Today's Drop,m2gbqy,"Hey everyone! Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.

- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.
- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real ""smoking gun"". Some of the evidence has been:
 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.
 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/gqin9qf/)
 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.
- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.

This is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!

**I know today for some of us was still a +7% day, and for others, it was an ""uh oh I am freaking out"" kinda day.** So I have been looking in the Mega-Thread and I stumbled upon a comment about a GME analysis! **I watched a few of this guy's videos and I have to say I am impressed. He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**

**It won't let me link the vid, Idk why but lookup:**

GME Stock - FUNDS ENTERING - BULLISH OUTPERFORMANCE - GameStop Prediction for Tomorrow, March 11th

Rember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.

1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.
2. **We are still up $10\~ 7%, after a 60% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!
3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!
4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???

TL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.

7002,In need of Confirmation of these damn Shorts,m2g3es,"Alright, I just need some clarification for this ape. Because logically, short selling makes no sense what so ever in today's society besides for the hedge funds. >Correct me if I'm wrong<

&#x200B;

So simply, there's a lender out there that feels like lending a stock (random example) that is currently at $10. A short seller thinks that stock is gonna do horribly and is probably actually worth $2.50. So the short seller borrows that stock, and sells it to Joe down the road for market price of $10. We wait and see that the seller was right, the stock is now worth $2.50 and is able to buy the stock at that price, returning it to the lender at $2.50 and pocketing the other $7.50.

Now what I don't get is why the lender or the buyer would want to take part in this deal. 

&#x200B;

For the lender, (unless it's a stock that they're probably never going to sell, it could dip to 1 cent but they plan to hold on to it, so why not lend it for a bit of time) they lend a stock that's worth $10 and get the same stock returned, but now worth $2.50. Why do that when the lender could just sell it themselves for $10? Is it truly just people who never plan on selling that lend?

And Joe who buys the stock from the short seller, loses $7.50 value on that stock they just purchased from that seller. The seller obviously doesn't tell Joe that they think the stock is shit so Joe buys it. And it just comes down to the seller being a shitty person trying to make some easy gain.

&#x200B;

Am I missing something? In the day of the dinosaurs, sure the internet wasn't a thing so it was harder to be on the up and up with stocks. But technology is all around now. Please explain to this smooth brain.

Speaking only for myself, I know that the only way to get 100k per share is to ask for it. I also know that the only way to keep my shares from being borrowed is to have an active sell order in place.

That is why I have put a sell order in for 100k per share.

I know that I can only speak for myself, as an individual, and this is most definitely not financial advice for any sort of community.

I just know that having active sell orders in for 100k is the only way for me, an individual, to obtain 100k per share. For myself.

I certainly would not want to find myself holding liquid shares that my broker may be loaning out to hedge funds. This would be, in my mind, a very unwise decision. For myself.

Edit: or the highest sell limit my broker allows.

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk. Plainly, I am not a financial advisor.**

&#x200B;

How many times will the ""big guys"" agitate the bees nest. How many times will ""they"" coordinate against retail without any repercussions? How many times will they call retail ""dumb money"" until finally a wrinkle is formed and retail attacks back. 

There is no we. Every one of us will back stab each other. That doesn't mean each of us can't have the same goal: Getting paid. And getting paid requires some type of intelligence and some type of strategy. I am a nobody, and I can't give you specific dates to do anything. And following a rando internet dude is probably a bad idea. But I can say if you got some sense, you can ""tell"" when the right time to place your ""bet"".

&#x200B;

Read the article and make up your own mind. Add this to the new tool belt retail is creating. Each of us can fight back individually, or like the article says, swarm those mother fuckers.

7184,$DGX Quest Diagnostics Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo,m2dtqk,"So a few weeks back I posted a DD for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx\_quest\_diagnostics\_is\_free\_tendies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)

**TL;DR** **so you can get back to $GME memes:** $DGX is the safest double up+ opportunity in the market right now. Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.

............................................................................................................................................................

As is WSB tradition, my one and only concern (a general market downturn) came to fruition shortly after posting the initial DD linked above. So my sincerest apologies for tanking the market over the last couple weeks. I'm now in your debt and, like a Lannister, intend on paying up. Continue reading unless you hate money.

Quest presents a very low risk opportunity to double up at a minimum. No, it probably won't be a 10 bagger, but you'll at least be able to use the tendies to cover your taxes after $GME moons. **So here's part 2 of my $DGX callout (read part 1 first you jackass):**

$DGX has been trading at roughly $11 PE for over 2 weeks now. The share price remains literally FLAT vs pre-Covid February of 2020. Which is hilarious considering:

* All significant competitors are up AT LEAST 20% in that timeframe. Including Labcorp.
* Back to back Qs of record breaking Revenue (50%+ y/y) and EPS (100%+ y/y).
* A plethora of additional reasons from DD part 1 linked above, **including $2B in share buybacks announced and approved for 2021.**

This is practically a ZERO risk trade, which is even more incredible when considering recent market volatility. Since 2006, $DGX has only traded below a PE of 9 once....doing so for a mere 30 days. It has typically traded around 15 PE during that time overall. I know, I know. You're thinking *wtf is this guy rambling about historical PEs for. And he already said they are at 11. And 11 > 9, I think, so WHO CARES?!*

**What if I told you that the EPS guidance given during Q4 guidance puts their diluted TTM EPS at 14.38 through Q2 of 2021?** To put it more simply for the slow kids in the back munching on crayons, if EPS targets are hit, then **$DGX would need to be trading at $144/share to result in a conservative PE of just 10 by Q2.** If they return to 15 PE by serology advancements, acquisitions, base testing rush, and share buybacks, the share price would be $216. Key notes:

* Guidance was only given for first half of 2021. They will beat the top revenue and EPS #s given. They ALWAYS do because this mgmt group is a bunch of sandbagging pricks. They were the kid in school that always said he failed an exam, only to receive a 98 and set the curve for the class. **Rev**: $4.85b to $5.15b. **EPS**: $5.07 to $6.07.
* \^ They. Will. Beat. Both. Top. Numbers. But my 14.38 minimum EPS above uses a conservative $6 projection anyway.
* Additionally, management stated the EPS guidance given does NOT factor in an unprecedented **$2billion authorization of share repurchases, which is a massive amount when you consider 90% of their outstanding shares are owned by institutions.** For context, they seem intent on repurchasing **6x the amount of shares repurchased in 2020.**

The overblown trashbag ""analyst"" concerns remain the same from DD part 1. COVID testing will just disappear over night and Quest's core business will take a while to return.

* COVID faucet is gonna get shut off quickly, eh? Yet in reality, public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through Feb for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)
* Even as COVID testing drops off, it will be offset by massive returns in $DGX base work to pre pandemic levels. Personally, I think there's a strong case to be made for a rapid return in their base business as people catchup on postponed doctor visits and procedures. Small boost from employment screenings as well.
* I've spoken with several Doctor/PA/Nurse friends across 8 different hospitals and they've said that over the past 2 weeks they've seen a dramatic shift in patients. **They are SWAMPED, but not with COVID patients.** This anecdotal reinforces the bullet above. DGX base business is going to return quicker than people think, AND they will still be able to continue a large amount of COVID testing (still happening based on the #s, just less hospital involvement thanks to drive-throughs and other 3rd parties).
* The $1.9T stimulus package includes $50 billion specifically for ""testing and contact tracing"". The bill also references an unspecific amount for serology/analytics/researching viruses.
* Quest also has seen a dramatic uptick in users on their tech platforms: Quest Quanum (provider focused) and MyQuest (patient focused). You can bet they will be able to monetize this data for research too down the road. In this day in age, data is everything.

**Price expectations by end of year. Raises vs part 1 as I've gained more testing/quest data into Q:**

* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown, this baby is a lock.
* Best case - $200

**Positions**

* Sold position (2/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks
* Holding: $50k in shares
* Open: May 21 $125, $130, $140. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Long live GME.

Edit: someone said this isn't big enough of a  YOLO, so let me give you some backstory.

I originally shorted 600 shares, but when the stock climbed to 270 because this ape factory pumps harder than my wife's boyfriend., I had to sell almost all my positions, and then also reduced my position.

why did i have a stop loss in the first place? so i can sell my shares and buy the dip for more of a profit and more shares


edit: actually i lost more than 400, i lost the potential gains from my average being at 207. learn from my mistake

side note: i still have my RH account with a lower average, that didn't trigger a stop loss, so im still in the game. tomorrow i will seek my revenge and buy more shares hopefully my 13 again

**Please DONT let the hedgies play with your mind, AND HODL!!!!! Keep strong my fellow apes, and Let's go to the moon! THIS WEEK WE WILL REACH THE MOON!**

I've been holding positions in both stocks (AMC and GME) for more than one month, and I know more than one have already noticed this trend, but I wanted to post it here, so the people that haven't noticed can see it.

At the top you can see GME's charts, at the bottom AMC's charts, left side is ONE DAY chart, and right one is a ONE MOTNH chart. As you can see every time GME spikes or goes down, AMC follows, you can say, it is the market that is moving all together, but that is not true, I have position in other 10 stocks, and I have checked other stocks and I know for sure this cannot be just coincidence.

**NOTE:** *Don't take my word as a financial advice, because it is not, I am not a financial advisor, neither a CAT, I just love both stocks so much that every hour of everyday I am looking at these charts.*

Edit: Typos, and fixed format.

I am not a financial advisor, and I just like the Stonk. But here’s my financial advice anyways.

We did it, we burned the hedges, but we’re not done yet. They need to burn at the stake for the things they’ve done and said. People are excited because we got GME to 200+ (again). Guess what? Who the fuck even cares. It doesn’t end here, right now, many of you beautiful apes are getting a stimulus check from uncle Joe, regardless of whether you love him or love to hate him, that’s free money. Think about all the apes 🦍, like me and you, that are going to dump all their money into stonks. It’ll be crazy. We thought $1000 was the goal. NO. We can go even higher. Because when life gives you a banana 🍌 you fucking eat that banana. Bananas make apes strong, when apes 🦍 strong 💪 apes win. The real squeeze has only begun, we still got a week or two of hard fighting. Biden is set to sign the bill this Friday. Hopefully we get our bananas 🍌 the following week. 


I’m not sure if you’ve ever seen what a banana looks like when it’s squeezed really hard, but that’s what we’re going to do to the short sellers. We’re going to make hedges look like a banana that was squeezed by fucking king kong.

Edit: And we’ll use our profits to watch godzilla vs kong in AMC theaters.

Edit#2: We’re waiting on the stimmy, which will be signed Friday by Biden. Allow a week for everyone to get their money, but people might get before then. So we’re likely going to see some elevated volume and likely  prices from the 17th  onward. In 2008 the hedges funds got bailed out with our tax dollars as thousands lost their homes and killed themselves. Now we’re using our tax dollars to kill the hedge funds.

Aight you retards. This some serious shit we gonna go through. Strap in because the so called, ""2nd squeeze"" will be big, even though it isn't the squeeze we all know will eventually happen that will fk over HFs and allow us to finally land on Mars with Elon's rocket ship.

Alright, so looking at the chart for GME over the last 3 months, we can see there is a large spike after the initial run up, highlighted by the small white box before the large blue box. From corner to corner (closing prices for those days) is what I believe is the ""run up"" before the ""squeeze"" (just a metaphor). **This area goes from $19.95 to $43.03, or an increase of about 216% (x2.16).**

**Now, when looking at the blue box that follows, we can see that from corner to corner we have a price** **range of $43.03 to $347.51, or an increase of 808% (x8.08).** Now, when comparing the increases on both days, we can see that the 216% ""run up"" over a period of 7 trading days led an 808% gain, or a x3.74 increase. This means that for each day that passes within the ""run up"" is an increase in the multiplying factor by 0.534, resulting in our 808% increase for the apparent ""squeeze"".

*Just to double check, with that x2.16 increase of the run up, we can apply this and multiply by 3.74 (0.534 \* 7 days). This leads to the 808% increase that we calculated above.*

So, assuming that this x0.534 factor stays true, let's apply this to the recent ""run up"" we had starting 13 trading days ago.

Over this period of 13 trading days for the current ""run up"", **we have a range of $44.97 to $262.99, or a 585% increase (x5.85).**

Applying the ""run up"" factor of 0.534, **13 trading days \* 0.534 = 6.942 --> 6.942 \* 5.85 = 40.61.**

40.61 \* the closing price of today ($262.99) = A closing price of the height of the ""2nd squeeze"" of $10,680.02, or an increase of 4061%.

**TL;DR: We will have an increase of about 4000% during the apparent ""2nd squeeze"" to have a share price of $10,680.02. Hold the fking line.**

Of course GME is one of the biggest or most noticeable ones but look at others - the dip is the same. Was there some news or was it a big, massive, ""UGE"" sell off by a single entity? Or.... my conspiracy theory brain is firing away but my logical self has to think this is normal and there is an explination.

\-----------

Something happened at 12:17 and lasted until 12:40. You can see it in a lot of stocks. It's so precise. Exactly 12:17 and each bottoms the V at 12:40. Even the ones that are ""off"" are off by a like minute.

GME exactly 12:17 crash. Over at 12:40

AMC - exactly the same time

KOSS same time

RIOT very similar with a small spike 1/2 way down

PLTR - same dip

TSLA - exact same dip

RKT crashes at the same time but doesn't follow the same dip pattern after falling

SPY a similar downtrend during the timeframe but times not exact

QQQ a drop starts at 12:17 but recovers at 12:38 not 12:40

Russell dip starts a minute earlier and ends a minute earlier

Only stocks I have looked at that haven't followed the dip so far are:  gold, crude oil, unmentionable coinage, ORCL, and Boeing dips but doesn't go straight down, it's buried in a bigger overall upswing for the day. I am sure there are more but what is the pattern?

&#x200B;

**EDIT** \- **conspiracy theory**: I read that the PPT (plunge protection team) works during midday / lunch hour on their ""market corrections."" Could this be the government interfering to prevent a huge spike and following collapse that would require billions in bail outs should it squeeze?  I know they are not supposed to interfere with the market, but the belief/conspiracy theory is that they do. 

Either way - someone doesn't want GME back over $400. It's hard to believe that this could be tied to any other stock. (Of course, it could be coincidence, but COME ON MAN!) Of course, the correction afterward was pretty fast and furious so was it an attempt to stop or just stall?

Lets see the results...

https://preview.redd.it/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4

The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**

We have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.

**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**

We established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.

If a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**

***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***

**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse

7402,Detailed Analysis to Explain What Happened Today. Just Look at Volume.,m2b4ur,"**TLDR:  $GME Volume during 12:20pm - 12:41pm crash indicates this was either a large  whale sell order (unlikely) or algorithmic short selling (likely). Keep  HOLDING!**

Just like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.

Let's dive in.

[$GME Daily Chart and Volume](https://preview.redd.it/zq8ft5pm4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57cbbd3d5c04822441a1ffa5c3d3028b473eab5f)

Let's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.

[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https://preview.redd.it/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)

As  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.

This points to two possibilities in my mind.

**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**

The  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.

**Possibility #2 (Likely)**

The  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.

**Conclusion**

In  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember... ALL SHORTS MUST COVER!",1615445076.0

Or like the crash earlier was a good time to buy don’t let em get into your head if you have the cash you can buy more stocks if it’s at a cheaper price to average out but if your not confident in it passing your new cost average be careful might tuck you 

pre market and post market can be good tools but be careful there imo 

Don’t panic sell

Use recent support and resistances as anylsis and consider long term support as well to assess overall position 

I do think there was an organized crash at the same time of Gme and amc by hedge funds that had short positions

Fuck the news they don’t want us winning 

Seems like hedge funds are bribing some media agencies to mainly cover crash not good news 

This is all opinion 

Yahoo finance was buggy today I hear it tends to be but I think they bugged charts intentionally today

It would show then disappear at oddly bad timing for ppl watching the stock 

Or just bug completely could be servers idk 

Roblox ipo was not started until after the crash right after funny timing...

The amc Gme crash time is the exact same 

They want us scared and selling because they’re scared 


After a severe crash on the day still up on the day and last I checked after hours(could be different now) is good signs

Don’t let them get into your head if it’s a good time to sell and your happy with the price he’ll ya but don’t let em scare you it could hit 300 plus again tommorow it could hit 200 but we hit around 350 before that weird crash 

How they arranged it idk wheather they all teamed up to to flood the volume and sell to panic us and get the stock Lower in general or they targeted limits and stop loss limits to crash it idk

Theory take this as you please it’s all opinion 

Use settlerd funds if possible to buy so you aren’t as locked in as far as needing to escape early general advice but using settled funds is always nice unless your 1000 percent the stock will be better in about 3 days and that it’s worth it",1615445016.0

The super smart monkeyfellas maybe already noticed (so probably nobody cause nobody is reading this anymore)

In January it took them about 80 minutes to dumb the price to 152$... (I am just rounding here cause you get the idea even without the exact numbers)

[Totally legit free market chart #1](https://preview.redd.it/r3aof66q3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=165aba2a4936c5cb95cbc581dcb86b0850bfacbc)

This is how it looked today... It took them only 30 minutes to dumb the price back to 219$ per share (I guess it even dipped to 170$ right?).

[Totally legit free market chart #2](https://preview.redd.it/5sqw42gr3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5778b689a9b70a610791d86580a3ae84f5ca2e3)

So that is already pretty sus ... but not yet finished - lemme get a new banana for the next part:

After this huge dip the price stabilized - on both scenarios:

On the first ""peak"" in January it looked like that:

Today it looked like that:

[Moving back up - Ending at 265$ per share](https://preview.redd.it/23svayjt3am61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc24225fdc141f8bb0d4c8ac5715575d443fc451)

So it seems like this total madness already happened to us on January 28th. Somehow I totally deleted this painful experience from my brain - probably some retarded diamond hands copeing mechanism ... They did it once and we returned back!

Sadly this story doesn't end well as many of you apes might know - the stock kept diving into the ground. Probably there were other circumstances with Vlad scking the hedgies dcks and stuff .. but as a retarded ape who has 35 shares @ 118

[proof](https://preview.redd.it/w3wfs8ru3am61.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=20462650a24dba6d6341676370729b645ad56f4b)

I am kinda pissed. I really hope that this time the whole thing will turn around and don't get dumbed like last time. Cause if this isn't market manipulation at its best then I dont know.

**TLDR: STAND TOGETHER AS APES!! DON'T READ WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BIAS!**

This is definitely no financial advice - I don't even listen to myself so I definetly wouldn't listen to me when I were you- Just some crayon DD on my beloved GME Stocks

If you go to search for the article that is posted in the screenshot of MrDavidNIO's tweet ([Exhib A](https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061), [Exhib B](https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369769100830904320)), you'll see that there is no such MarketWatch article under that exact title. However, on the RH app, if you scroll down to the News section of GME, it still lists the MarketWatch article with the **original** title, ""GameStop stock was reaching new heights, but the meme stock just plummeted"". If you open the article, you will see that it is the new article with the revised title, ""[The meme-stock roller coaster just reached new heights of volatility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208)"", which still has the full **original** title in the **URL**.

It's difficult to make causality statements with the limited facts, but I feel that they point to the possibility that this was pre-written with knowledge of what was coordinated to happen.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, I was up to $11K in the first hour of market open, but that dwindled away fast as the sideways movement yesterday killed the premium on the options. I was glued to my screen, and watched as each minute my balance fell more and more.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ar2bqghh0am61.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb49c7054a1051bd24c2675fe21a52dba4ee9f40

Then today, I was initially down in the morning just for a minute but suddenly, things picked up big time. At 11:00AM, **I was up $32,000.00.** I currently owe about twice that in student loans, and I told myself I wouldn't sell until the options were worth what I owed in student loans (I refinanced my loans so they are now privately held, and thus I have no hope for forgiveness).

Then, the GME drop and halts happened.

My $32,000.00 dropped to next to nothing in minutes.

While a strike price of 500 for Friday is... doable, it's pretty fucking risky at this point. And with each passing day, the option premium drops significantly (theta at one point was like -4.2).

So, I waited a tiny bit  after the batch of halts (I was basically gambling yet again), and the options were finally about double the price I originally paid. I didn't want to be a slaughtered pig, and rather than focus on the $32,000.00 I missed out on, I realized I should be fucking happy I was able to get out with over $5,000.00 in profit.

I had bought the contracts at an average of $4.8, and sold at $7.05.

**TL;DR: I don't have diamond hands, but I'm not ashamed.** I also am proud that my trade didn't have an impact on the hard work all you apes are doing in holding shares (since they are options contracts).

7600,Today's GME manipulation,m29259,"Okay retards. Here is what I think happened today while you were busy shitting out the crayons you had for lunch. 

Today's GME dip was clearly a short attack. Most likely manipulation based on the sketchy timing of some articles, but my point is independent on that. I think as fucked up as it is to hear this, some hedge funds won on this one and that can even be good for us. Hear me out before you start screaming like the apes we are. 

First, there is absolutely no way retail had anything to do with this. We sure as hell  didn't cause such a strong dip by paper handling coincidentally all of us all of a sudden,  this was an orchestrated short attack. The interesting part was how it bounced back. And I believe that again there is no way retail had anything to do with it. How much money do we really have left to fight such an enormous dip at this point? We are balls deep in already. We apes keep saying to each other ""BUY THE DIP"" but let's face it, we ain't got no money left to buy the damn dip. We have put everything we have and beg our wife's boyfriend to give us some ramen noodles for dinner. 

So here is what I think happened.

1) Short attack by hedge funds which caused many stop losses to be activated. They then covered back that short attack, making gains from panicked day traders, stop losses, algos that started selling and paper handed bitches. 

Or

2) The bounce back was again made by hedges, opposing ones this time. It's a war out of there and even though most hedge funds are owned and run by corrupt greedy douchebags, some of them are on our side, the long side of the trade. Or they have no skin in the direction of the game and simply like volatility. These are the ones that profited from today and fucked the shorts.

So what now my fellow gorillas? We view this as a good sign. Even if some hedge funds won, either the ones that shorted and profited like in case 1, or opposing hedge funds like case 2, what we want is high volatility. High volatility leads to more madness, more shorting and more chaos. This is what is gonna send us flying to the moon. We won't fly to Jupiter on a 5% day gain, we need the volatility. If you hate volatility go play boomer stocks.


TLDR Hedge funds are most likely at war. High volatility is good for us. GME to the moon.",1615440291.0

7676,GME Cautionary Tale,m28ibs,"Today’s dip was fucking delicious but it taught us a few things:

1.) Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot 📄 🙌🏻 for you?

2.) Half of y’all are fucking gods who bought the dip, and got a damn STEAL on some guaranteed lottery tickets 💰💰💰

3.) The other half of y’all weren’t actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time our time to put our NUTS on the hedgies chin. 🌰🌰🌰

The actual important shit:

1.) They are running out of ammo, those drops had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They’re running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame.

2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this far up in the share price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now. This is potentially a good thing because it means no influx of uneducated monkeys who know jack shit.

3.) We need educate new members of this fuck wagon on what is going on. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.

Side note: NEWBIES! YOU’LL KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING! IT WILL FUCKING SKYROCKET *$5000+ MINIMUM. DONT SELL (unless you have to I know everyone has varying circumstances) DONT BUY UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A HIGH VOLATILITY STOCK. SHIT GOES UP DOWN BACK FORWARD, FUCKING BACKFLIPS. Stop asking stupid shit and hold on

TLDR; Remove your stop losses. Weaponize the newly born apes. Everything has led to now. The media has sorta fucked off, paper hands are long gone. The shorts have one bullet in the gun and they’re saving it to shoot themselves in the mouth. Hang on and have fun. Love you apes 

I’m not a cat, I’m an ape.

As far as I understand it is either an issue with Fidelity Trader Pro's ability to keep up with trading... orrr it's sell limits that have been set around $340 that are being hit by market buys? Which, again.. am retarded, but if the latter is accurate then would that mean there is a massive amount of volume on low liquidity, as in there are so few shares available but everyone is trying to trade?

Is that at all reasonable to assume? Is anyone else seeing these ridiculous candle wick spikes? I saw them in reverese back when GME tanked early Feb.

Edit: I know there isn't an insane amount of volume in general ( 69 million right now - 3:49 pm EST, niceee) but just relative to the liquidity - total question, I am not sure

I am just saying that this looks really similar to todays drop from $348 to $172 and we could be seeing the last hedgie trick before mooning starts again.

7850,Gme @$350 question/theory. Why its crashing when it hits that mark?,m278es,"So i have a theory, when GME hits £350 it appears to me that something weird happens like robin hood cancels or there is this flash crash today.

My theory on this is there is an algorithmic thing going on with clearing and retail purchases. As we know it can take up to two days for trades to fully execute. During which time the broker and clearing house are on the hook if there is a mismatch/bad match or other cock up. This risk is massive if there is large amounts of volume in one direction as the clearing house or broker could be the bag holder and then the share price drops. As such brokers and clearing houses probably have limits on their exposure to such issues.

My theory is volitity and rusks hits a predetermined levels in the computer, and then the clearing house stops accepting orders from brokers.  They probably have bench mark for what they determine is the floor of the share value and a probability that of it dropinh while executing in the next 2 days.

So when the “over valued” order hits a difference of x eg £350 and say the bench mark £40 and the historic volatility hits y% change per day say 40% swing. The computer stops accepting thinking there is an error which causes robin hood to put up more capital thus they respond with the buy order ban or the clearing house goes NO causing the flash crash as it effectively does the same thing.",1615435974.0

8051,Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1/3 of GME and AMC,m25szi,"Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!

Edit:
[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6)

I obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. 

For you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. ""A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy"". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. 

I thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.",1615432420.0

8393,Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT) DD from Feb 10K,m248be,"***TLDR:*** Stick to GME or AMC for quick tendies, buy SKT shares as a longer-term play (\~1 year-ish)

Tanger Factory Outlets Centers (SKT) was fucked during the onset of Covid and has been beat down by Banks and Hedge Funds on the belief that Retail is dead making Tanger the 2nd most shorted stock. I read over their February 10k and came away with a strong belief in them. Tanger seems to have a recipe that works with their outlet design and has made a number of smart consolidating decisions over the past quarters to ensure their continued existence while returning to Pre-Covid levels of sales and activity by January. Despite some claims that Tanger is the next GME I don’t see that case. It has the potential to explode later this year, with May or August earnings providing the action that could ignite the existing kindling, but Tanger is definitely a long-term hold stock rather than an FD or weekly options play. I would aim for a price of $20-$25 by summer's end.

&#x200B;

Below is my overview, cons, pros, and what I see as a reasonable future path.

&#x200B;

***Company Overview:*** Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. They are a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2020, their consolidated portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.9 million square feet, which were 92% occupied and contained over 2,200 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. They also had partial ownership interests in 7 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.

&#x200B;

***Cons:***

&#x200B;

**Getting fucked by Covid and negatives consumer trends related to their business model have made them the 2nd most shorted company behind GME:** The main factors behind their current position are that they have been fucked by Covid and the fact that they are at their core a collection of huge retail brand store fronts off the highway.

&#x200B;

**Tenant Bankruptcies and Defaults:** In context to Covid a large number of their stores were closed, some rents payments were delayed, and there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers at their locations (an increase in recovered square footage from about 1.75% at end of 2019 to about 8.3% of rentable square feet in 2020). Some of the tenants went through liquidity hardships and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tanger recaptured approximately 903,000 square feet within the consolidated portfolio related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, compared to 198,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a direct result of the pandemic, bankruptcies, and restructurings discussed above, the Company's earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $47.3 million due to (1) write-offs related to bankruptcies and other uncollectible accounts due to financial weakness, (2) one-time concessions in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to lease structure, (3) reserves for a portion of deferred and under negotiation billings.

&#x200B;

**Most Likely will not Increase Rent:** Tanger’s leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain Tanger’s standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of Tanger’s leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. Tanger has historically been able to renew many leases at higher base rents per-square-foot and replace underperforming tenants with new or existing tenants in Tanger’s portfolio. Given the current retail environment as discussed above, Tanger may choose to renew certain tenants or execute leases with new tenants at lower rental rates to maintain a high portfolio occupancy rate. This is some of their lease agreements include co-tenancy and/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if Tanger fails to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. Their occupancy at our consolidated centers has declined from 97% at the end of 2019 to 92% at the end of 2020. If their occupancy continues to decline, certain outlet centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact their results of operations.

&#x200B;

**Retail decline:** Certain retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet, and other forms of pressure on their business models.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Pros:***

&#x200B;

**Tangers Model/Outlet Centers:** Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third-party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential while also allowing these brands to maintain a foothold in high-density population centers without a high-cost storefront.

Tanger’s consolidated outlet centers range in size from 104,009 to 739,110 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores (so outskirts of major cities). Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Most of their outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, their centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.

They have a diverse tenant base throughout their consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 manufacturers, brand name and discount apparel and home retailers.

No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of their combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no single tenant accounted for more than 7% of their leasable square feet or 7% of their combined base and percentage rental revenues.

**Perk of REITS for dividends.** Because Tanger is a REIT the ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of their common shares. They also have to make distributions with respect to their then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of their taxable income each year. They froze their dividends in 2020 but reinstated them in early 2021 with a dividend of $0.1775 per share paid in February 2021. Because of this high dividend payout holding the stock at least gives the benefit of decent dividends while waiting for a potential squeeze.

&#x200B;

**Return from Covid:** As of December 31, 2020, 99.9% of total occupied stores in their consolidated portfolio had reopened, representing 99.9% of leased square footage and 99.9% of the annualized base rent.

A number of their tenants requested rent deferrals, rent abatements or other types of rent relief during this pandemic. For March 2020, Tanger offered all tenants the option to defer 100% of April and May rents interest-free, payable in equal installments due in January and February of 2021. Their rent collection rates on contractually billed fixed rents were significantly impacted during the second quarter but steadily improved during the second half of the year, as the Company collected approximately 63% of second-quarter billed rents, 91% of third-quarter billed rents, and 95% of fourth-quarter billed rents.

&#x200B;

(checkout rent attachment)

In addition, traffic during the fourth quarter represented approximately 90% of prior-year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January. Governmental mandates effective between late December and early-to mid-February impacted traffic at the Tanger Outlet Centers in Canada, and excluding those centers, domestic traffic was over 99% in January compared to prior-year levels. This is a ridiculously good sign that there returning to pre-covid levels of demand even though only 20% of the US has been vaccinated. With a stimulus bill passing on the horizon, pent-up consumer demand,  and a planned influx of people traveling along highways and going to vacation destinations where Tanger has outlets I would not be surprised if they had stellar summer earnings. This would be the gasoline for a potential share price jump but wouldn’t be enough to kick off a squeeze.

&#x200B;

Finally, let's talk about what I think could be the item that kicks off a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

***Share Repurchases :***

In May 2017, Tanger announced that their Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125 million of their outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019. In February 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $44.3 million of their outstanding common shares for an aggregate authorization of $169.3 million until May 2021. After purchases in 2019 and 2018 the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $80.0 million. The Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases for at least twelve months starting July 1, 2020 as the June 2020 amendments to Tanger’s debt agreements for Tanger’s lines of credit and bank term loan prohibit share repurchases during such time and in order to preserve Tanger’s liquidity position.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Tanger has a pretty sizeable share repurchasing power that is currently on hold due to their debt agreements from when they shored up their lines of credit and borrowing power in 2020. Because their share repurchasing power will be authorized until May 2021 there is a chance that at their 5/10 Earnings Report they could roll that ability forward to this next year (2021-2022) and when their share purchasing restrictions drop on July 1st, 2021 they could announce a share purchase program where just under 5 million shares could be bought back by the company. This would provide the desired squeeze effect and really put pressure on the shorts assuming they don’t take the time to cover between now and then.

&#x200B;

So it is very under the radar and not large enough to get big institutional money. That being said.... it is super undervalued as compared to it's peers- it's quite astonishing, at least to this smooth brained degenerate.

* From the image above you can gather the following information
   * This stock has a P/E of 7.5 way way way low - this is price to earnings for you apes that are still on the gorilla teet and barely understand market cap.
   * They pay a 2.00 dividend which is a 3.5% yield. Just owning the stock you will make monies.
   * They are small, 1.5B market cap, but profitable.

# The comparison to peers!!!!!!!!!!

* Look at the chart below
   * it's P/E is way better than the industry average.... 7.5 vs 21 this is incredible.
   * It's Price to cash flow is 8x better.
   * It's price to sales is nearly 9x better....... This is absolutely insane.
   * Price to sales is 4x better
   * Price to book is 6x better this

My analysis is that GME has to go up over 480 because
1. It came down 95% 
2. The only way to moon is over 480.
3. Every day close price is higher than the previous 
4. Maybe every one is tricking the suspend switch this time at Saving Elite Crowd by going it slow as an airplane rather than as a rocket. Comfy rides are a plus. 
5. The business goals and the team looks amazing and might have impactful earnings due to the release of PS5 and XBOX in Q4 and now the actual digital transformation news

9020,LUMN (Lumen Technologies) should have a lot more upside as the transition to value continues,m225xd,"LUMN has been one of the value plays that's gotten a lot of money shifting out of high growth tech the past couple of weeks, and if that trend continues, it should have a lot more upside over the next few months.

Lumen is the old CenturyLink rebranded (the telecom that bought Level 3 which basically runs a lot of the internet backbone in the US).  The stock was punished due to indebtedness and reduced earnings from cord cutting by residential customers over the years, but it has basically pushed most of its debt out years as it focuses on the transition to fiber and 5G (only 30% of its debt matures the next half-decade and that's all easily manageable through free cash flow).

The stock has entered a long-term channel where it's found significant support/resistance over the past 5 years, and if it breaks above, I think it will basically be cleared for a big run.  It's picked up support from institutions due to the strong dividend and that also has helped it to attract buying flows as a value play.

It was one of the stocks that rocketed in January due to the GME fueled market-wide short squeeze, but has been a straggler this week as high growth tech has attempted to find its bottom.

Still, I think the mid-term outlook for value stocks is probably better than high growth stocks given valuation levels and the likelihood of a big uptick in inflation in the 2nd half of this year as vaccinations and pent-up demand release a huge amount of consumer-driven demand in the economy.

Here's the chart and how it could play out over the next few months:

And this is look at the 4 year chart so you can see the channel it's entered (and why it's important as a place of support/resistance):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pa98scivc8m61.png?width=1805&format=png&auto=webp&s=2baa68e905d98688c276a0534a97e3d59b57ac3f

I expect short-term consolidation in the channel or maybe a bit below (which is a good place to buy for cheaper calls), but any breakout should be explosive and would be hard to play if it happens since calls would probably become expensive fast very quickly.

Easiest way to play it is to just buy long-dated calls out to July or October.  Something like July $17.50 calls or October $20 calls are pretty cheap right now because IV is surprisingly low on a stock that's experienced the past 3 months that it has.  If you want to play more aggressively, something like April 16 $15 or $16 calls are pretty cheap all things considered.

I own April/July/October calls, and I anticipate holding them at least the next couple of weeks to see whether there's more money flow going from growth to value.

This is also a decent hedge position to have alongside high growth tech if you do own that (as I do).

As always, do your own DD.  This is a low risk stock play, but a high risk options play.  I've gotten 10-20 baggers on similar setups, but there's no guarantee this will work; it could just as easily go down as up.",1615424228.0

User base gee exponentially because of work from home no schools and all. Company is not in profit but does look like ready to launch itself.Board looks good and shit looks promising. The majority of Roblox’s revenue comes from virtual items, but the company has recently rolled out a subscription service. It’s also recently begun working with brands like Marvel and Netflix for in-game branded content. I see it as a long term investment than ska quickie.

In the recent days we've seen a beautiful increase in GME stock value. It looks like MOAS might be coming after all. The price moves up on a daily basis in a very stable fashion, which is very different from the January rollercoaster. Most sources agree that short interest has dramatically decreased so it really makes me wonder why we're witnessing such a beautiful spectacle. 

With all the meme noise on WSB it's really hard to find any well composed explaination on what exactly is happening and why it's happening. There are a couple of DDs but they're from a week ago or older.

9469,ASO: Early Bird Special,m1zcsv,"Academy Sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139% earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40%. If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. 

ASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. 

This is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. 

Getting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions ""shaking out weak hands"" or GME's first pop. 

I understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.

I currently hold 20 April 16 $25c, and 5 April 16 $35.",1615417159.0

9475,AMC Squeeze Me Harder Daddy,m1zbjr,"We the apes, in order to create a more perfect union, do solemnly swear to present to you all the due diligence that you will need to make an informed decision. Join me on this journey fellow banana chasers.

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we’re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming “We like the stock!” could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However… one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or… peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there’s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ← with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn’t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don’t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won’t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don’t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: 

https://i.imgur.com/w6WCJag.png

Sources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io

**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**

**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade
**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted
**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)
**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes
**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions

**Harambe’s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME’s 12M shares with AMC’s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME’s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher “Days to Cover” than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe’s trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.

tl;dr: The writers and DDers of this:

>Me, Ape 1: 1 contract, 90 shares. Bagholding some at $15 but bought in more at $10. 

>Ape 2: 40 contracts, 600 shares

>Ape 3: 8 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 4: 59 spreads, 6 contracts

>Ape 5: 40 contracts, 100 shares

>Ape 6: 400 shares, 10 contracts

>Ape 7: 69 contracts, 1361 shares.

Fellow apes, this is very simple but first let me say sorry for the picture with portuguese words but I assume most of you can read any language anyway. Well the picture above, not only points to the moon, but also shows - via google trends - that ""trendwise"" GME & Gamestop are at the same level as they were back in 2020. This pictures the reason behind the blackout that is going on around the media: it can be very very dangerous (read interesting for us) if this thing gets the smallest bit of media focus because it will just fuel the biggest rocket launch in the whole security history.

9513,Datto (MSP) Earnings Report,m1z1u4,"Take a minute away from $RBLX and GME today to check out this play:

A month ago I posted about Datto, $MSP([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6a3g/datto\_msp\_options\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6a3g/datto_msp_options_play/)), a backup/disaster recovery service & network equipment manufacturer for IT Consultants(Managed Service Providers), and how there was a solid options play around their earnings report on 3/11. A month later, and that play still exists.

The $20 call options for 3/19 ask is currently $5.90, and the stock is at \~$25.30. This means the stock only has to go up $0.60 during their earnings report release tomorrow for this to be a winner. Seems like a really low IV, and a solid play. The $25 call option has a really low bar to make money on it too.

Not financial advise, I just like the company and the stock, and options gambles.  


EDIT: $25 call option jumped in price, but the $20 call is still good looking($25.70 threshold for profit, and stock at $25.38)",1615416337.0

9632,GME and the Chocolate Factory,m1xj6s,"After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my children, then watching the 1971 movie, the GME events were predicted 40+ years ago.  I included pictures to help guide you along.  I hope this is helpful for you apes.

Here is my analysis:

* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor 🦍.  
* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing ""Not-a-Cat"" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors 🦍 of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) 🍬, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. 🎫
* Large corporations 🏢 buy large amounts of candy (stock) 🍬 because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) 🏰  is going to fail. 
* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets 🎫 in the candy 🍬 they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.
* With candy supplies 🍬 being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs 🚀.  Not liking this, the corporations 🏢 restrict limits on the amount of candy 🍬 which can be purchased.
* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket 🎫 has been found.  This sends the price of candy 🍬 crashing.
* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. 🎫  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy 🍬 increases. 🚀  All this time, Charlie had 💎👐.

***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** 🏰 

* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.🍫  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. 
* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry 🔵, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.
* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels 🐿 opening the nuts 🌰, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut 🌰 opening squirrel 🐿 instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel 🐿, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut 🌰 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel 🐿.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.
* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room 📺, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High 📈, Sell Low 📉.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.

***Other Characters***

* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda 🍾.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda 🍾.  The soda 🍾 causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.
* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper 🍭.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?

***That Scary River Scene*** 👹

* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??

***Conclusion***

* In the end, Charlie held 💎👐 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon 🌚🌚🌚.



***TL:DR;***  Charlie 💎👐 crashed through the roof, 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon 🌚🌚🌚.  The others paper handed, tried to distract Charlie, and got roasted.

Also, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:

# 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🌙💎👐

First, let's look at the players involved here.

# The shorts

On the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.

# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)

Marker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the ""fools"" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).

# The longs

On the long side, we have you glorious apes  🦍 🦍 🦍, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.

Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this.

It all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.

[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)

[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.

# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze

Some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).

First, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))

Now, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.

At some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.

Similarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.

Remember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.

You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.

# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?

Some people ask: ""Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?"" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).

In fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be ""name your price"" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.

# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:

**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**

~~Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in~~. That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant.",1615407721.0

Once we break through the last one, we're re-testing the ATH for sure.

I love this stock. I wish I'd bought more before, and as the price rises, I'm torn about how much more to YOLO. And something occurs to me...

No one knows how this is going to play out. We know the price must rise, but no one knows how much by. No one knows when. No one knows for how long. No one knows how much ammo the HFs have, or what the hidden rules are. No one knows the shape of the journey ahead.

Here's one thing we do know: THEY WILL CHEAT. They will use every trick in the book, then they will invent new ones. We can laugh as they dig a deeper pit with shorts and buy more dips, but even a smooth-brained crayon-eating yadda yadda something something retard should expect they they still have new tricks that we haven't seen yet.

I sense a trap.

The market mechanisms are on our side for once. If we buy *what we can afford to lose* and HOLD HOLD HOLD, either we will win or the entire market system still disintegrate. I LIKE THOSE ODDS! But this strategy depends on the HOLD HOLD HOLD part.

Fellow apes: if you can't afford to hold what you buy, DON'T buy more!

If you remortgage your house, YOLO the college fund, and get leverage up to the tits, there is a chance that the HFs will find a way to artificially (and presumably illegally) crash the price, and through whatever arcane black magic find a way to keep it low as your mortgage payments keep coming in.

STAY LIQUID, apes!

Make sure you can pay the bills!

Spend *whatever you can afford to lose* on GME, but figure out *how much that is*, and for the sake of discipline set yourself a target price to STOP buying at. Maybe stop buying at $1k, or $2k or $10k or whatever, figure out your own number IN ADVANCE and STICK TO IT.

Gambling is an addiction, and even if you win, addiction can shatter families. If you buy at $5k and the HFs manage to drag the price down to £100 for six months, you're going to have to look at your wife and her boyfriend through the kitchen window every morning, knowing that the price will spike again but still having to sleep on the lawn.

DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE TO SELL.

SET A TARGET TO STOP BUYING.

GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BEFORE THAT POINT.

&#x200B;

There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Hertz, all that shit. This is what the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question if the bull market is coming to an end.

## Blow-Off Top

A “blow-off top” is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.

>*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security’s price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

As a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.

## Why the Current Rally Might End

The S&P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*

The S&P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.

[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?

As stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.

When Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?

With stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.

## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue

Which of the many reasons do you want to hear first?

I’ll start with the latest from Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),

>\[Biden\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.

This is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.

And as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What’s in the past doesn’t matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.

The news of vaccines and thoughts of a “normal” society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.

Need a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century. Sure there are some downturns, but it always comes back and sets new records.",1615391984.0

10056,Why Gamestop is still undervalued today,m1qhjn,"First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was ""our fault"". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.

Hedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.

Deep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*

Skip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**

Ryan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...

Except Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**

So what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.

Let's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.

Let's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.

So two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.

Let's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.

- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue
- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue
- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue
- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue

There are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.

Using these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.

Have I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.

Then we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.

Oh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A ""Build-A-PC"" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.

What does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**

#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.

By the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**

That's right apes, I shall be rich asf and still be an autistic ape. I shall reach the level of rich, that I can call the robbing the hood CEO's little boys with chump change and clown them on a regular basis.

But either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that ""hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!"", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**

So let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.

# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.

With COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.

Hedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**

While some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...

# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.

People like Michael Burry and Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.

After GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.

Finally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.

# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...

But before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *""short squeeze""* and *""gamma squeeze""* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""short squeeze"" is when lots of people ""short"" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**

**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""gamma squeeze"" happens when many people make lots of  ""call"" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**

**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.**

**If this high volume of ""call"" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**

# SKIP POINT

**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**

# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.

# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...

**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**

# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021

What was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.

# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.

Before more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous ""call"" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.

After all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.

In less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...

# Yet this is not how GME ends.

Just a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.

Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.

During the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**In other words, a ""short squeeze"" hasn't happened yet.**

People found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.

They found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.

Not only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.

Ryan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...

There were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...

People began exercising call options once more, and now...

# The GME rocket rises once again...

# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their ""call"" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.

# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

10128,Roblox $RBLX direct listing - some half ass DD,m1ow80,"I’m thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I’m doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Roblox is NOT currently profitable.

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let’s try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I’m a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let’s low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let’s estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That’s another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn’t have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don’t know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I’m gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn’t even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...

So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.

I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn’t fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I’m not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I’ve got tomorrow am. I’m a high risk, short term profit guy - so that’s I’m betting on. But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening. After looking deeper into the rockstars on the Roblox team, and typing all this shit up on mobile - I like the upside.",1615377830.0

Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?straddle=true)

pretty simple format too for those limited on how many words they know

ITM @ 245 (current price as of market close 3/9/21)= 35,540 calls (3,554,000 shares for those new)

OTM

@ $600 strike: 64,167 calls

@ $700 strike: 66,369 calls

@ $800 strike: 90,484 calls

I was taught to show your work so here you go lmao

[sorry its in a stupid ascending order. but it goes 35,540 + 11,927 = 47,467. then 4,759 + 47,467 = 52,226. and so on. I had to make it retarded somehow ](https://preview.redd.it/dlvv168pw3m61.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd5ff70d50752c7c9196f993788e191ac838696)

also, fun fact, all calls added up for next Friday @ $800 a share is 216,666 calls

Ok retards. So I was one of the apes who bought GME during the first squeeze, and instead of holding or selling at the top, I sold and lost my life changing gains by selling at the absolute bottom of almost $40. So naturally this didn’t bode well with me, but I have a really really good idea.

So I have decided here and now that I will take out the biggest, juiciest, fattest loan and I’m gonna YOLO all of it on GME. Now I know what you’re thinking, I’m completely retarded, and you’re right, I definitely have a few extra chromosomes than the majority of you apes. But this plan is foolproof, I have no debt, I have good credit, and I simply don’t give a fuck because this literally can’t go tits up. 

I’ll either retire early or “retire early” if u catch my drift so it’s a win win either way. I’ll update you guys as soon as I can find the meatiest loan to yolo into GME and I’ll see you guys in my million dollar mansion and Tesla in a few weeks. Also if GME breaks 700 I’ll go into GameStop and buy every PS5 in stock and give away every single one of them.

TLDR: YOLO money I don’t own to become a multi millionaire 🚀 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: someone thought I was gonna off myself lmao don’t worry I’m only gonna retire early when I make my millions thanks

Edit 2: you guys don’t understand how much faith I have in GME and all the apes here it’ll go to 1000 and I’ll retire ez",1615366473.0

*The win was identifying the fucking shorting. The next win was having Papa Cohen take the wheel. The next win was these morons doubling down their short positions, hiding them in ETFs and generally just being smooth brained HF's who wouldn't accept that they'd already lost.*

&#x200B;

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true 💎🙌

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/0qhnzm2rm5m61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aedb83543448c586fc3415ffe4c0c991f6bd16e4)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant 💎 nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many 🍌 🍌 🍌 as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his 🍌..

Being the ""predatory"" 🦍 Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more 🍌 🍌 . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar 🚀 travel still exist.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? ->! I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.!<

&#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/r3qxmmbum5m61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114542bfd9691be40edcc93e5f18397d360b5c2e)

&#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

&#x200B;

# The BIGGEST test of 💎🙌 comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* 🚀🚀🚀)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[How you WILL feel holding all those unrealised tendies.](https://preview.redd.it/lkdpir0xm5m61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc890a0d7215309daa5d8d6a7e31f1ea21af4de9)

&#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider 📄🙌 and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! 💎🙌

&#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your 🍌's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few 🍌.

&#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 🍌 @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS 🍌 - Price Rises.

🍌 rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

(EDIT:  Hypothetically Billy could also do this - **🍌 rises to $9001 (over 9000) - Billy releases 1 singular banana and covers all his initial cost and takes the wife and her boyfriend out for expensive McDonalds.. leaving 49 🍌 for fuck you money**)

&#x200B;

Billy retains 42 🍌 **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more 🍌if there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&#x200B;

Billy is a smart 🦍

&#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

&#x200B;

# This empowers Billy.

&#x200B;

[BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" 💎🙌](https://preview.redd.it/llwytxlzm5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65d718cd902554ca26423734f66e971cd371a67)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

&#x200B;

[Yep. This dude. Fkn great for us apes, and the A-Team he brought with him! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dvn1t27n5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3161a08d422070f3ffbf455ba7ff400d86336fc)

&#x200B;

# Flash forward a few weeks or months...

# (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM too soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&#x200B;

# ""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

&#x200B;

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

&#x200B;

# Billy Holds 42 🍌 (Risk Free bananas, the sweetest kind)

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 1k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 2k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 8k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 16k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 32k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 64k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 128k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 256k

... You get Billys point.  


\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* - Billy is kinda pissed at the FUD and that blatant MSM cuck up the other day reporting early on a dump. So... Given the fact that GME Ownership is around 300% of float.. (With Retail unknown.. but I would imagine very high) We have \*NEW\* figures to potentially ""cover"" at.. See below for Billys revised listing:

&#x200B;

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 100k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 200k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 400k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 800k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 1.6m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 3.2m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 6.4m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 12.8m

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 25.6m

&#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 🍌 ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 🍌 left.... That's a fkn lot.

&#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 🍌 @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

Am I saying that the right choice is the only choice? Not at all. But the wrong one will leave you behind. Am I saying that you need to buy GME and TSLA? Again, not at all. All I'm saying is that to bring ""power to the players"" you need to bring the power. You are the player in the institution's game, they leave you powerless. But together we bring more power than they have ever seen.

I urge you to take a step back and look into the future. What do you see? Is it you looking at your charts saying ""I wish I would have bought"", or is it ""I'm glad I held""? Now come back to the present, look at your potential. Look to the stars. Because you aren't just going to hit the Moon, you'll come crashing through it and go to where no one has dared to go before.

You can make your own decisions, but you can't go back in time to change them. Make the right decision to band together with everyone, tell the suits to shove it where no man wants it shoved, and create a movement that changes the market forever. You are the change we need. You are one of many that will follow. Lead the pack because the rest will get left behind.

So let's say it all goes down as hypothesized; all those specific conditions engage and the rocket does indeed blastoff moonward.  Then what?  I guess as the price gets higher and higher more people will begin to be unable to resist the tendies and sell, causing the stock which we like to inevitably plunge back down.  Is that correct?

However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

First, let’s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.

# What is Counterparty Risk?

Counterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some 🦍🦍🦍 in an obscure subreddit sent GME 🚀🌝 so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob’s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.

# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the “Solution”

This is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.

Title 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.

# Why this doesn’t really work

What this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they’re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.

This is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn’t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can’t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can’t meet their margin call (aka your average [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) 🦍), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.

See, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that’s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary / service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.

So what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven’t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says

* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses
* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.
* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.
* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook

# Tin Foil Hat Time

Now here’s where I’ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who’s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME 🚀🌝? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.

However, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I’m too lazy to actually research this data, although I’m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it’s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.

This is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don’t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there’s so much volatility that it’s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.

Okay, so let’s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel’s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they’re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel’s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.

Obviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.

*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*",1615361669.0

10521,A volume based model for $GME SI.,m1j3q5,"This will be a long one for my fellow autists out there. I thought about short interest rates and trade volumes for a while. Mainly because I wanted to find a value that is harder to manipulate then the most other trading values. Of course you can manipulate trading volume by playing stock ping pong, but that would be expensive over a long period of time. So I decided that would be a good base value to spend some time on.

First of all I spend some time on daily short trading volumes, reported by Finra:

[http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)

and filtered for GME. Here is a chart of daily trading volumes including short sales and a daily short interest line based on that. Starting on Jan. 4. (dates are written in Europoor style DD.MM.YYYY):

&#x200B;

[Daily short trading volumes  ](https://preview.redd.it/0icmss2b43m61.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe593963525da81e8181da1c458a74a0a0ad09c)

This data set represents aggregated volumes traded on the NASDAQ, NYSE and OTC that has been reported to Finra. And can also be found here:

[https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GME](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GME)

When you compare the daily trading volumes to the published numbers by MW:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme),

the Finra daily short volume data represents \~ 50% of the daily trading volumes. So it should be quite representative. Now, if you think about it, what does a daily short interest of 0.5 (50%) mean? Imagine a market that is only traded by daily short selling and (re-)covering. Example:

*Short seller sells 100 shares short into the market and buys them back later that day. Resulting in an aggregated short selling volume of 100 and trading volume of 200, therefore resulting in 50% daily short interest.*

However this would completely neglect any other trading activities by other market participants! So according to different sources 10% - 25% of the market are driven by non institutional participants:

[https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers)

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/retail-investors-quarter-of-stock-market-coronavirus-volatility-trading-citadel-2020-7-1029382035](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/retail-investors-quarter-of-stock-market-coronavirus-volatility-trading-citadel-2020-7-1029382035)

Since HFs are heavy trading GME, I decided to go for a low approach of 3% of retail trading and an additional up to 12% depending on market width and uptrend of the stock, because these are factors that would attract day traders and long buying retail. For the period of Jan 28 – Feb 8., I decided to set it to 0% because of the trading limitations at the time, also if many traders weren’t affected. I hope you can see what I’m doing here... I try to keep the numbers as low as possible in short sellers favor!

That means depending on the market conditions the threshold line in the picture above moves a little up and down. The interesting part are the areas in between those two lines. If the daily interest rate is above the threshold line that results in a net increasing of shorts that day and in the opposite case the opportunity to cover, if it is below.

But we also have pre- and after- markets which are not represented in the data and are likely used to cover daily short positions. Therefore I had a look at borrow rates from: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). Of course that’s only an fraction of the available shares to borrow, but it gives a good impression of the daily market sentiment regarding tendencies to cover. So I assumed if there were new shorts issued one day and on the next day, there were more shares available to borrow, the previous short positions were likely covered in the pre- or after- market.

So, I also took that into account and extrapolated the results on the total trading volumes. I used the Jan. 4 short interest rates of Finra (260.91 % SI of 46,89 mil shares float) to start my calculations because I expected the whole “covering” by options (“synthetic longs” and such; also described in this paper by the SEC: [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)) to happen after this point in time.

This leads me to the following chart of short interests which I use for a while now to get an impression of short interest rates:

&#x200B;

[Modeled short interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/sf4n1v8r23m61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b3ab27f6a3d0bbde92d2e77cfc0b39c498d574)

I don’t claim this to be 100% accurate but it maybe gives an idea what SI rates could be like. Probably is needs to be shifted a little down to at least fit the first 3 red columns. But trends in SI rates should be derivable.  

BTW if I increase the percentages of non short selling and covering related volumes, the corresponding SI rates increase rapidly...

One can observe, that at the market stall on Jan. 28 short sellers began to recapture their positions. While they were really covering the days before. After that, a detachment of calculated and reported values occurs. Maybe because the models fails? Maybe because of the more creative ways to “cover” and abilities to dilute the float described in the paper mentioned above? 

You could argue, that short sellers could cover by selling ITM puts or buying calls. But wouldn’t it be cheaper to buy stocks directly? Besides that, if someone sells covered calls or sells shares by exercising puts, the majority of these shares are likely to be purchased within the period under review and therefore already embedded in the model.

But everything right now is too perfect.

Please be aware of this.

If I were a hedge fund right now I would be co-coordinating a fake squeeze. This is the only sure fire and likely way to cause most retail investors to exit their positions. This is also the easiest way for them to join in their fight against us longs and diamond hands. I am certain this will happen soon.

What will happen?

Hedges will continue to allow the price to rise, 300, 400, 500. By this time the whole world will be back into buying GME and it will potentially go to $900/1000 a share on momentum alone. At this point half of Wallstreet bets (the new paper hands) and potentially this sub WILL sell half, if not all their shares. I don't like this idea anymore than you do but this is likely to happen. Most people have lives and bills to pay and $1000 a share is too attractive.

From here, the hedgies, along with the sell off with mass attack the price down easily to probably pre 100 numbers. Much like a month ago, then we will be back to another long wait. This is their only way out. They will be able to buy back shares and would possibly even start shorting again. Sure the main squeeze won't have arrived but this will have put so many shares back into circulation for them. Meaning we will have to wait much longer for the real thing.

How does one counter this?

Acknowledge this is coming and stop looking at the share price as a number.  💎🙌 forever - this is the only way. You have to be the strongest psychologically you've ever been for an ape.

I believe in you all. Good luck.

💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌 💎🙌

TLDR: The share price probably won't shoot to 100k a share without another huge hedge attack to drive most people to exit their position with a more attractive exit price than the first gamma squeeze.",1615360281.0

My name is Paul Rozanski and I’m a Psychology student at the University of Pécs in Hungary. The events around Game Stop and reddit have been amazing and too great of a research opportunity to pass up (a requirement for my program) so I got approval to carry out some research into how reddit, this community specifically, feels about everything that’s gone down.

&#x200B;

This link is for a survey about people’s views on Justice, Fairness, and Institutional Investors.**Edit:** This one is rather long because of the framing items that have to be included. In total it's about 70 1-5 scale items.

You can fill out both they're not mutually exclusive. Naturally any and all data will be kept confidential and this research is non-clinical so it’s not as if I’m going to go ahead and diagnose everyone with some pathology or another. And of course if you have any questions you can message me here or at [nec.di.nec.domini@gmail.com](mailto:nec.di.nec.domini@gmail.com)

If you can help out with a response that’d be great. If not then I understand and hope you have a pleasant rest of your day.

10551,The Best Case Scenario (and why it should actually happen) 💎🙌🚀,m1ip16,"Well, I guess it's about that time again. I realized I haven't posted any flowery psychology bullshit in over 24 hours, and my fingies are starting to itch. So I'm back once more with what I believe to be the most likely scenario that will play out here. And once again, the key metric that will guide us through this process is that of:

PAIN MINIMIZATION

You may have read a recent post about what's called a Keynesian Beauty Contest, in which participants are rewarded for selecting what they believe would be the most popular choice overall, rather than their own personal preference. But I believe this fails to capture the whole picture, because it doesn't consider the penalty for being the most harmful, only the reward for being the most accommodating.

What we need to consider are both sides of this coin, from the perspective of all players involved. How can both sides of this trade, the market, the regulators, the government, and the unwitting public all benefit, or at the very least, not be hurt too badly by the eventual outcome when the dust settles? I took the wrong approach last time I tried to dig into this, and tried to list every possible scenario. This time, I'll give a rundown of what I believe to be the single least damaging and, by extension, most beneficial scenario.

RETAIL INVESTORS

Okay guys, you'll have to bear with me here, because I know a lot of you don't want to hear this, but most of this post will be sunshine and rainbows, so allow me to temper expectations just a bit. I think retail holds. I think they will be allowed to exit at or around the peak, somewhere within 80-85% if they're paying attention. And that SHOULD be somewhere upwards of 500k/share. But by the same token, maybe it shouldn't be. I cannot predict the effect that the price spiking to something absurd like a million per share would have. That said, I am quite certain that 100k/share would have a negligible effect, and is a good place to establish a floor with which to work off of. How long you hold past that will be up to you and your risk tolerance, but I do think you should be careful. 500k is not a meme based on the DD. Nowhere close, actually, but keep in mind that there are other players involved.

LONG INSTITUTIONS / WHALES

This one is fairly simple. There are a few ways these guys could play this, but with the exception of individual whales who are completely unpredictable (but always greedy), these bigger players will want to maximize profits for their investors while simultaneously bolstering their own image and garnering retail support. If acting in a vacuum, they would hold until whatever they calculate the ceiling to be, then be the first ones out the door. 

But this scenario is as unique psychologically as it is economically. The global retail market is watching them closely. At the moment, they are being praised for their responsible actions and holding with us while pissant hedge funds are taking all the heat. But those little hedges have caused a disproportionate amount of uncertainty compared to the assets they control. Retail is looking for any reason to maintain any faith in our market, and if a behemoth like Blackrock were to end a rightful squeeze and leave millions of bagholders out to dry, they would only deepen the hatred retail has for the market, even though that action would be entirely legal.

As another popular thread from yesterday pointed out, you will indeed be able to sell on the way down. As will they. The smartest play here is to establish a price target for themselves that would maximize profit while also allowing the market to survive largely unscathed, then slowly unwind their positions, allowing attentive retail to close their positions at attractive price points. They'd have helped facilitate the squeeze, kept their sterling reputations and even bolstered them, lined their clients' pockets, and millions of new grateful tendie-holders would be flocking to them, begging to pay them management fees. 

This would crush the small, corrupt hedges, whom they assuredly hate, restore faith in the market, consolidate market share, please their clients, earn them new ones, and grow their recurring revenue streams tremendously. 

GOVERNMENT

They're either shills, or fucking morons, but even then, the course of action here should be obvious. All eyes are on them. Plenty of regs that make them look tough on Wall St but really fuck retail can come later. But right now, the whole world is watching. As much as Melvin or Citadel might pay you, you reaaaally don't want to piss off Blackrock or Vanguard. And as much as you DGAF about your constituents, you probably don't want to piss them off either if you can help it. Plus, if you just let this happen, you actually look like you're a friend of the little guy, instead of just paying lip service to it. And you get to collect a tidy 37% tax to do what you will with. Hell, you can even use it to bail out the DTCC if you actually believe they need it. 

The alternative? Well, that's up in the air. You could try to step in. Who knows if the market would ever recover? Who knows if you've got any shot at re-election? You did just fuck your base in real-time, after all. Maybe a few million bucks from the hedge funds would sway you into action. Just gotta hope there's still an America, let alone a market, for you to spend it in.

SEC/FINRA

I get it, they want jobs at the hedge funds. Can't argue with that. Just one problem. The ones still left won't have a lot to manage if all faith in the market disappears. Maybe you talk to Blackrock and the other big longs. Maybe you let them know you can only manage up to a few hundred g's a share before you have to shut it down. They can exit slowly at that price point, and most people end up happy. DTCC will get bailed out if they really need it. You can even say you were instrumental in obtaining this bailout for them. Yeah, you gotta get tough on a few nobody hedge funds. But now you've got a seat at the table with clients at the BANK level. I'm sure you could make do with a cushy IBanking gig. 

The alternative? Again, who fucking knows. The world already hates you. Despises you to a degree rarely seen. Maybe you should be on the right side of this one for once? And again, a job in Finance isn't all that great if faith in our markets ceases to exist.

DTCC

This seems to be the one people are most concerned about. I'd argue the SEC is a bigger threat, given how patently incompetent they are. Especially with the new proposed rules, the DTCC can basically play this however they'd like. Look at the players involved: https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories. You probably recognize more than a few names. The amount of capital they have at their disposal is staggering, and there are any number of things they could do that we can't even fathom until they happen. But I posit that, at this point, allowing this to squeeze to a reasonable level is by far the most prudent option. Whether they want to try to keep it around 100k, or let it go further intentionally and angle for a bailout isn't particularly important. The only thing that would be truly unconscionable would be to make the SEC/gov step in to break one of the cardinal rules: All shorts must cover. People will fight me on this, but 2008 is fresh, and January even fresher. This would be a colossal third strike, and the implications are unimaginable.

GENERAL PUBLIC

The one no one's talking about, and the one that inevitably gets fucked the worst in most scenarios. You might think that a deep correction or mini-crash would be terrible for them. It certainly wouldn't feel great. But with retail reinvesting a large percentage of profits, their portfolios will recover, and the tale of GME will stimulate investment. They wouldn't wanna miss out on the next one (that's never coming). But if the government or SEC steps in, and the fallout is as bad as I predict it would be, those portfolios may never recover, and they'll see firsthand that normal people simply ARE NOT ALLOWED to succeed in this country.

​

TLDR: Sorry for the long-winded thread, yall. This is my opinion on how this should play out, and how it would cause minimum pain and maximum gain to the most amount of players involved. The only real loser is the shorts, and not even their own colleagues like them. Government/SEC intervention could very well be a death sentence for our market, while allowing the squeeze would result in rapid recovery and profound social good.

In 2009 (ONE YEAR AFTER the 2008 CRISIS) Griffin had the audacity to pay himself the lumpy sum of $900 MILLION salary, after Citadel being on the verge of bankruptcy just ONE F\*KING YEAR AGO! Citadel declined these figures, according to the article linked above they were published by the New York Times at the time. On top of that, he raised his pay up to 1.7 BILLION $ in 2015.

Read the article for yourself and do your own DD and look up other sources. But for me this is enough reason to HODL my lumpy single digit number of GME shares forever.

10618,"This Missionary of $GME has Converted the Family, next the neighborhood?",m1hnq6," Many weeks ago, an Angel appeared before me.

With  flowing locks of gold and eyes shaded to prevent my soul from being  destroyed by gazing upon their magnificence, he shook the sky as he  spoke in the tone of a disappointed Father, 'Gamestop will connect the  world to the virtual marketplace for not just the tangible, BUT the  Intangibles! Who else hires employees that actually care about the  product they are selling and want to see you enjoy yourself with the  coolest new games and classic oldies? And yet you do not buy this  supremely attractively priced stock?""

Then,  He showed me roads of diamonds filled with the Biggest, Fattest retards  I have ever seen driving lambos, bringing back the 'High-Five' (to show  off your DiamondHands), and a kitten that looked like Nick Naylor  swimming in money. ""These are the fruits, and the bounty for those who  listen to my words.""

And then, I  was taken to an island floating in fields of fire and around me ---  heads on stakes (including an ironically named Vlad), melting Bentleys,  hedgies being deep fried into tendies. ""Here is the faith of those that  seek to destroy American Companies to make billions. A sea of fire in  the morning and acting out my favorite Harvey Weinstein Scenes with  Harvey in the afternoons. The Meek Shall Inherit!""

Finally,  as he vanished into the heavens on the Biggest Rocket that I have ever  seen he called out, ""Do not forget, a man named Jonah and the fact that  you live near a river, if you disregard my commands!""

After this, I bought $GME.

""Weeks  of pay into a dumb strip mall store!"" my family said as they laughed at  me.  ""What a foolish, stupid thing to do! You are going to go broke.""  my parents said. ""Please don't lose our money on wars the people can't  win!"" said the wife. My friends said I was going crazy from being inside  so much. ""Go Build an Ark next they said!""

But now. They have become quiet.  The great flood has begun!

All will attempt to climb onto the GME Ark, but will never be able to hold on with their PaperHands as $GME goes to $1000!

Don't stop unto the End of the Rainbow! YOLO!",1615356343.0

10628,GME Adjusted Future Value as compared to Amazon's online Electronics' sales.,m1hk6h,"Hey Guys, 

I went full retard and thought to myself, hey GME plans to become Amazon of electronics right? So why don't we compare these two when it comes to market caps and their share values.

I might have went full autistic and I used Amazon's Market cap and online electronics' sales as values that are correlated.

MKT CAP: 1.54 T, 

Total Rev: 125.56 B

55.1% Of revenue is Electronics = 69.18 B

Amazon's share value is rounded to $3000, # of shares is 503,000,000

GME $250, # of shares 69,750,000

Assumptions:

GME will steal - 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of that business. This is ignoring all of the other things that either of the businesses have going on for them.

55.1% of 1.54T = $848.54B (Market cap value)

25% = $212.135B (Market cap value)

50% = $424.27B (Market cap value)

75% = $636.405B (Market cap value)

90% = $736.686B (Market cap value)

100% = $848.54B (Market cap value)

Add current GME's Market cap of 15.53 B to each.

Adjusted GME Share value when they steal amazon's % of electronic revenue with those Market Cap Values:

25% = $3,264.01 per share

50% = $6,305.38 per share

75% = $9,346.74 per share

90% = $11,171.56 per share

100% = $12,388.10 per share

SO WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SELL FOR LESS? THESE ARE NOT EVEN SQUEEZE VALUES. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS, A BIT RETARDED, AND HOLDING FOR MY LIFE. 

GODSPEED.

10775,"What brokers y’all use? Robinhood cucked me way too many times, fuck them and citadel",m1g2q8,"As title says. Robinhood literally never executes my options without a massive wait. I just was day trading some BAC options and I’ve run into two problems.

1. They lying:
Idk if anyone has run into this issue and as retarded I may be I wouldn’t do it twice. Both times I was day trading BAC. Essentially I go to double down and instead of buying more it executed a sell and closes my positions or when I go to exit my position it would make me buy more instead of closing the position. I could be retarded here but I wanna know if it’s me that’s the problem or if it’s robinhood doing some fuckery. So have y’all had a similar issue?

2. They won’t execute my orders:
I’ve had now several problems where BAC locks me out of profit by not letting me execute orders. Now I trade stuff that’s LIQUID AF aka BAC. The contract I was trading had nearly 6k OI and 13k in volume. It’s the $26 March 12 put. I had my order sat at $29 for nearly two minutes and it didn’t execute while the price indicated $29 for the put during the whole 2minutes. That may not sound like a lot but it is if ur day trading. Long story short BAC reverse and I ended up selling for a massive loss compared to unrealized gain. I also got cucked on RKT since I bought debit spreads and robinhood refused to let me sell them. The stock went up 70% but robinhood didn’t let me sell them for 20% gain and my spreads were ITM deep and liquid.

Edit: I remembers I had more dirt on robinhood

3. They openly steal:
So I notice this whenever I day trade options and currently I can see it in my portfolio as clear as day. They will tell you “we sold your contract for $25” and you bought at $24 so why the fuck is there less than $1 gain in my portfolio. Big money might not notice this but they literally steal in pennies from your options order. Tell me you executed at 24.98 if u want to steal those two pennies and don’t lie to me. This one HAS to be illegal unless they have some fine print covering it cuz as far as I know options are only traded in dollars and not pennies so why are two pennies being stolen when is supposed to be “FrEe TrAding”

I’m looking for a broker that’s free or has reasonable fee’s for options trading with a friendly interface. I don’t care for charts since I use trading view and coin flips. 

I need four things:
1. Buy button
2. Sell button
3. Button showing me the price
4. Fast execution",1615352142.0

""It's dangerous,"" or ""you will lose all your money,"" constantly telling me to conform to the ""old way"" of earning money, putting money in a reliable ETF or Bond and waiting for it to mature in 10 years making 7% in the process. **But thanks not only to GME, but to you apes, I have been able to make more money (and lose more as well- lol) from the INSANE DD AND DISCUSSION on here.** I have now spent hours learning and trying to improve my financial literacy because of you guys. **Us apes might have just began a new wave in the global market.

10869,Why brokers are not accepting limit orders at prices far above last traded price.,m1esm0,"After moving from RH, I was getting frustrated that TDA and other brokers wouldn't let me place set it and forget it limit orders for GME at really high prices.  I only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest.  I called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone, no dice. The explanation they gave me was that it is not their call, it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price.  The broker claimed that the MM's have finite bandwidth on their order books, so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price, then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price.  Since the MM's don't think that it's possible for the price to moon that quick so there's no chance of ever being filled they don't allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled.  Which, LOL, then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0DTE options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week?  I did test this to see if it was true both ways. I tried to place a limit buy for GME on TDA at $1 price, and it rejected that for being too far from market price.  Does anybody know the mechanics of how MM order books and fills work to confirm whether this ""bandwidth"" claim is legit?",1615348711.0

Man if we like to think we're autistic, how fucking retarded do you think the SEC is?

What about all the evidence that points towards predatory hedge funds shorting companies out of existence at extremely high levels of risk?

I believe the rocket will take off, and I believe it will be to tremendous values. But I caution anyone who is looking at January’s action as a reference to be resilient, because it’s possible that some will view any significant dips as manipulation similar to what RH did at the end of January, and end up panic-selling. I’m certainly no expert at these matters and who knows what crap can and may be pulled, but be strong, and don’t assume that when we hit the $400 range that any significant dips are manipulation that require VERY-premature selling.

TL,DR: Hold past the $400 range, don’t sell on dips there, regardless of January manipulation.

I will take some of the proceeds and and donate it to the WallStreetBets Museum of Autism on 5th Avenue in Manhattan that opened last week; the original piss-drinking martini glass was amazing to see in person as was DFV's headband.

It's a bit lonely on earth now that the population has dropped by 9.4m but I will hopefully catch you on the next $TSLA moon flight next week. Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?

I dont seem to understand why all the call options lost volume from yesterday? Even Call options for strike prices that aren't reached yet.

Call options for march 19th also dropped from yesterday to today.Any ape that care to explain?

**EDIT:** Thanks for letting me know. I mixed up Open interest and volume. My bad.

11129,What's a contrarian view on the current trajectory of GME?,m1blt3,"I'm sure this will be get down-voted to hell, but here it goes ..

Here on /r/wsb, there is a fair amount of bearish sentiment that retail will be bagholders on GME ultimately, but there seems to be a lot more enthusiasm on it. The trajectory of GME's ascent this time feels different from the previous time, little volume on most days, less volatility than before, a much lower interest rate on borrowing to short.

Apart from the possibility that a) the HFs have given up, or b) the shorts have already been squeezed (mostly) and retail is actually just bidding up the stock against themselves while thinking that the HFs are on the other side (fairly large daily volume makes that less likely, but you never know), what are some opinions on here about what the hedge-funds are up to? If they are still exposed to risk, they seem to be playing it differently this time. They have a lot of really smart people working for them, and a lot of capital, so even accepting that they are greedy and fallible, they must have a plan for how to try to extricate themselves from this situation with as little a loss as possible.

How do you think they'll do it?",1615340060.0

Dear Apes.

Watching the GME stock market launch from my POV in the side lines is the best euphoria I had in a long time. I wasn't there when Apollo 11 got to the moon and this is just as good if not much better.

One of my triple monitor setup is dedicated to the GME stock in tradeview and this subreddit since January this year, the other monitors are for porn and stuff. Watching all the bs in the mainstream media has also been a hell of a show, made some popcorn a few times and i'm loving it, this event is already in my history books and i feel this is just the beginning.

I share these words with you brave wonderful apes with the intention to show my respect and appreciation to all mammals playing diamond hands in this game. Thank you all and keep up the good fight!

I've made this because apes don't have easy access to options data. While some broker platforms have pretty cutting edge tools for retail level investment, they're not clear or easy to use. So I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents some good information in a clear and easy to understand way.

&#x200B;

[Number of open option contracts for GME. Darker lines indicate more open contracts. Data scraped 3x daily.](https://preview.redd.it/i8a3d88nx0m61.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=404ee42aa7ff8144e148da08e619e4321025b1fd)

# Ok, so what am looking at?

This is a plot of all open option contracts on GME. For those not familiar, in the simplest possible terms, an option is a contract to either buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a price that you chose (the **strike**), and at a date that you also choose (the **expiry**). An option that will allow you to *buy* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *call*. An option that allows you to *sell* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *put.*

Since an option is a contract, two parties are required: 1.) The option seller/writer, and 2.) the option buyer. For every contract, there has to be a buyer and seller. So when you buy a contract, you are literally buying the *option* to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock.

On the other side of the contract, someone had to sell it to you. They are therefore taking your money in exchange for *maybe* having to provide you with 100 shares of stock if the price of the stock moved in your favor. 

The black lines/boxes in the plot represent the number of contracts 'open'. This means two parties have agreed to buy/sell an option contract between them at a given strike price and expiry date. If the contract is open, that means the buyer is still waiting on the stock price to move in their favor. If it doesn't move there before the expiry date, then the contract is worthless and the seller of the contract made money on the buyer. The dotted black line represents the price at time of writing. 

# So what does the data show then?

It shows a ton of contracts open at really extreme strike values. Right now there is a huge demand for GME contracts, so the price of *any* contract at *any* price is high. It appears that people are buying/selling a ton of put contracts at very low strikes. 

This means two things:

1. The people buying these contracts believe GME will crash down to these low values. They could also be people with lots of stock buying them to offset the risk if it crashes before they expect.
2. The people selling these contracts believe that even if the price of GME drops, it will never hit these low prices. Because all options are expensive right now, the sellers of these options stand to make a good profit if GME stays above $20. 

[Huge number of open put contracts below $20, expiring in mid April.](https://preview.redd.it/uy9h07dp41m61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=989a1b58ecf02ca8da5bead1d4ccb85d970328a9)

There are also some call options being bought sold at very high strikes, but nowhere near the volume of puts. The risk associated with selling calls is probably too great. 

&#x200B;

[Tons of open contracts at $800 and $500](https://preview.redd.it/ytgw4m2k51m61.png?width=5859&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32ab80650692991e74b820dfd467dfa3da0beb8)

# Get to the point monkey

It is my opinion that people or hedge funds are selling huge amounts of way ""out-of-the-money"" (low strike value) puts to try and make profit off of apes who think GME will crash in a month. It is also possible someone knows something I don't. Regardless, this information teaches us something interesting.

You see, as attention spans grow shorter and shorter, PR consists more and more of just distracting people for a tiny amount of time. If you can ride out a PR crisis for a few days, you're in the clear. There's always some other bullshit to pay attention to. So they bet their app and their reputations on this: if they could distract WSB for a few days, everyone would forget about GME. Sure some devoted apes would be on here throwing their turds around, but the power of the masses would be dissipated, never to return.

Ironically, it's you retards who proved conventional wisdom wrong. They threw everything they had at you, and you stayed focused and strong. They tried precious metals, an artificial dip, and constant negative media attention, but you all kept your eyes on the golden banana.

The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<

""So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.""

I've been going in and out of GME for the last few months now.I wanted to share a bit of experience with you guys, to make things easier for everyone.

Note that this is not financial advice, I'm just sharing my experience here.

1 - Panic Selling ruins your gains.The biggest mistake I made during $GME is selling the stock when there were bigger drops.In most cases, it got pretty frustrating afterwards, when they had more profits than before. If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.

2 - Being impatientThis directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.

3 - Not informing myself when to get in our outI always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.

4 - Not checking out wsb (Not looking at who you're with)  
The most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub. All the memes made me strong, we are strong together. Believe it or not, those made me less stressed. I just didn't bother looking at who I was investing with. I'm a very inactive reddit user, usually.

TL;DR: Don't panic sell, be patient, inform yourself and expect a falling stock once news make fun of WSB losses and check out WSB for memes to motivate you

Thank you dear apes for reading this. Cheers 2021 millionares and good luck in life!

11488,$GME DD : Technical Analysis shows Very Strong Buy Signals,m17zsb,"#  Intro

Welcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.

# Pivot Point

The pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**

For example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,

&#x200B;

[Example Candlestick Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)

&#x200B;

R1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily Low

R2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High – Daily Low)

S1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily High

S2 = Pivot Point – (Daily High – Daily Low)

*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point – Daily Low)*

*S3 = Daily Low – 2 x (Daily High – Pivot Point)*

**LINKING BACK TO GME**

&#x200B;

[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)

&#x200B;

GME-

Resistance Line 1: $195.13

Resistance Line 2: 202.33

Resistance Line 3: 215.87

*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**

*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*

# Relative Strength Index

*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100

RSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence

Above 70: Overbought

&#x200B;

[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)

Current GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)

*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*

**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**

**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**

&#x200B;

[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)

&#x200B;

RSI Value: 72.14

As seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.

# Volume Weighted Average Price

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price. *It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**

*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*

&#x200B;

[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[VWAP March 1st-8th](https://preview.redd.it/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)

&#x200B;

* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**
* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.
* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**

&#x200B;

[MACD january](https://preview.redd.it/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[MACD march](https://preview.redd.it/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)

&#x200B;

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline.

* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*

# Other Indicators

Since I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.

&#x200B;

[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**

Anyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**

11645,"For the first time since I invested in GME, I’m actually starting to make some money from it",m160s4,"

I bought my first share of GME on January 29th for $319.18. It went up maybe 5 dollars after that, and then it all crashed. I bought a few more shares as it went down, but I was honestly wondering if I’d made a huge mistake and just wasted my money on a dumb meme. I got my average cost down to $181.14, and I was planning on getting a few more shares later since I didn’t think it would be moving from the $40s any time soon. 

I was wrong, and I was honestly shocked to see the price quadruple in the past two weeks. It was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I haven’t made the hundreds of thousands of dollars that some people on here have, and I still don’t think GME will get me anywhere near that much. But for someone who has never made more than $10 an hour, any free money is more than welcome.

**DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.** Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. 

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss.

11690,Proposed Investment That Could Change Lives,m15adj,"I know you're used to hearing about fancy stonks, options, etc., but this post is meant to convince you to waste your money for the sole purpose of making a statement.

Recently it was reported that Melvin Capital CEO purchased a new Miami home in Sunny Isles Beach, Miami for $44 mil ([Fancy Home](https://www.glebklioner.com/blog/miami-real-estate/2020/12/10/sudcfe6epua69rwl8c6sfhbwg63sph)). Turns out there is an AirBNB nearby, overlooking the neighborhood but its expensive ($500 per night).

I propose we raise money to send DFV and his family on vacation to beautiful Sunny Isles Beach, Miami where he can casually stand on his balcony in a silk robe and toss $1 bills out over Gabe Plotkin's home. This vacation could allow DFV to casually run into Gabe Plotkin in a restaurant and buy him a drink. Maybe, see him on the beach and set up a long football throw that causes DFV to dive for the catch right in front of Gabe's wife catching her attention as the sun glimmers off of his diamond hands.

Degenerates were talking about a $10,000 investment for a week (AirBNB + Flights for DFV, Wife, and Kid), but it would be the perfect way to let DFV celebrate a life changing year. If this post gets 6969 up votes Ill create a fundraiser and contact DFV.",1615321298.0

11826,GME: are HFs let the stock price go up in the 500$ region - in a controlled way - so to finally convince paper hands to sell?,m13byb,"Am I the only one seeing the potential for this new tactic by the HFs?

Instead of trying to push the price down, which coagulates more people in the battle (and eventually attracts even more retail investors), they could momentarily try to control the rise to 300-500$, so to give the (false) impression that the peak has been reached.

Transforming lots of people's hands in paper (EDIT 2: especially if the price then is pushed down quickly)?

It would be risky and probably cost millions, but it would also save TRILLIONS and - in the process of going up - the HFs will find a way to make money in any case.

Thoughts?

**EDIT 1** \--> **TL:DR** ""I will convince myself that the HFs have STARTED to lose control only when the stock will be above 10K.""

**EDIT 2** \--> ""Market Maker “A” with the FTD can work in collaboration with Market Maker “B”. “A” locates and borrows shares from “B”. However, “B” uses a naked short to supply the borrowed stock.

* “A” no longer has an FTD.
* “B” is now naked short the shares and has six days to find and locate.
* If “B” does not find and locate, they have an FTD. “B” then can buy the shares from Market Maker “C” who executes a naked short, ad infinitum.

This is called rolling over a position and can be done for a very long time. Obviously, it requires a conspiracy between Market Maker “A”, Market Maker “B” etc.

This shitty advice, but proper documented, will not be long. 
The hedgefunds are abusively manipulating the price rise of the stonks starting last week and probably the first days after the stimulus reaches your account to make you wanna join the retard apes’ club of fighting the hedges. 

The hedges need to cover their shit and they wanna try it by using US GOV stimulus (individuals’ money) for fake rise of the stocks. Once you get the stimulus dont throw them at high prices of the stocks. Wait for a real, market regulated, dip process. Hedges are trying to squeeze your money at high prices. Look at the month of february, the did it the same!

They are artificially rising the stonks, making you believe the are on a pattern of getting to the moon!

For the apes having stonks, and holding diamond hands, you are doing the good thing, but remember what #DFV did, he sold stonks at the highest, waited for the market regulated dip, and bought...again. And he will do the same, soon! If you feel comfortable to sell, do that, do at your own recognizance

12038,"Academy Sports and Outdoors, more than a Short Squeeze Opportunity",m0xfvs,"

Academy Sports and Outdoors (Ticker : ASO) isn’t just the next Rocket or Gamestop. You shouldn’t view them as simply a squeeze opportunity. If you’re looking for just a squeeze and quick 100% gains without ever thinking about the stock again, this isn’t the post for you, it holds lots of info but I’m not spamming rocket emojis and this isn’t a P&amp;D scheme. 

Academy Sports and Outdoors is a retailer of sporting goods based out of Katy, Texas which is just to the west of Houston. They’ve been mostly concentrated in the Houston area, but recently have been expanding into areas throughout the Southern US. During their expansion their careful selection of store locations “has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. “ (From Wikipedia). They’ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 

As a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of Recreational Equipment Incorporated (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. 

I’m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I’ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren’t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They’re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings
just recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn’t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn’t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.

In the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can’t see what’s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. 

Not that I’m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy’s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. 

These factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today’s bullish nod from Barron’s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I’m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I’m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains. Best of luck to y’all in your endeavor for big tendies.

TLDR: Gun sales are rising and Academy is a major retailer. Have a huge advantage over competition in Texas and they have expanded throughout the pandemic. Excellent EPS growth, top-tier Return on Equity, and the debt situation is being remedied. Bullish nod from Barron’s and momentum on WSB is setting up a huge breakout.",1615288509.0

[The Hive Mind Trader - Theory](https://preview.redd.it/h0sal7sy2xl61.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d7033601ffa63fc64c10ad7f85df32b78ad1cc3)

I have decided to post elements of my work that have led me to produce proven theories with a very high probability of success. Such as being able to preemptively determine when GME will go parabolic. This is not me stating, this has been witnessed and utilized by others with a determining factor of success. To include the study of unique behavior patterns of individual stocks and industry. The thing about data is it is no good unless someone else can learn it and benefit from it.

&#x200B;

With that said, I am posting the crude work. At some point, I will clean it all up so it can be prettier and even have a flow sheet of sorts, but right now, I want to keep the focus on the depth of work and get feedback from others of like mind.

&#x200B;

I truly believe that this community of new traders has good intentions with their money. The ability to ascertain data that is truly helpful is scarce. We can seek out the most mentioned post or the percentage change of posts. However, that kind of data, albeit helpful, ends once the person clicks through. My goal is to treat my data like open-source code. If a person could take what I have produced and make it better, then the purpose has been served.

&#x200B;

This theory provides you explicit data outcomes that will provide you with what stock to select based on industry, 5 selected companies that share the same industry, the volume, price. As detailed in theory within, the data can be easily replaced to produce a different response as long as you follow the theory's criteria.

&#x200B;

At the core, this theory has derivatives of Newton's First Law of Motion:

*An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. (i.e., Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.)*

**EDIT 1**: I did forewarn it was crude, so I apologize about the chicken scratches. I am trying to perfect the theory. This is the very long-winded structure to the basis of my various theories. I can't go around and say,  **I can predict a GME parabolic event** with no basis in which to define it.

There is no TL;DR with this one. This is theory data and within is the algorithm in which to test it. I mean, if you could 10x your portfolio by piecing this theory together, your time would be well spent.

EDIT 2: Fixed a word that someone asked so nicely to fix. 

Edit 3: I will transfer all data from the images to a google doc. I don’t my chicken scratches to hinder interest or collaboration.

12084,An Investigative Report on Why Robinhood's Option Order Routing is Trash.,m0wfke,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE RETARDS WHO CAN'T READ.

&#x200B;

Alright buckle up retards today we're going to answer a question that has managed to elude retards and algorithmic options traders who use Robinhood to exploit their free option trades for years.

Why the fuck is option order routing so bad? It always seems like I'm the last order to fill.

Well let me answer your question with another question What happens after you submit an order on Robinhood?

That we do know the answer to, and we shall go through it very quickly. Robinhood has their own order router, this does all the ""paperwork"" a trade needs for it to be able to be processed by a Market Maker, or by the execution venue.

So firstly, your order is sent to the RH order router, this first checks basic stuff, dividend risk, collateral req. checks, avail; funds checks, margin checks, and a PCO(position closing only) check. If any of that returns a false argument, the order is kicked back. If that's all good, the order is flashed onto the PFOF desk at Citadel Securities, they pay top dollar for the sweet, sweet dumb money pfof, that they will always adjust their books so that RH's order router routes to them first. Now Citadel has a set time to do with this order(because the exchanged price is still changing and of course its not public which is fucking fair right?). They can one: if the limit order on the marketbale option order is theo(theoretical price) + edge(which is hidden information due to game theory reasons), then the MM will fill you.

This can and does lead to something called price improvement. For example if the 69c for $ASS is trading at a spread of 0.69-0.86, with a theo of 0.74, the MM takes a 0.04 edge on the position, so any order above 0.78 will fill, which is technically better than paying 0.86 at the ask.

The problem with this however, is the rights to your order. Customer orders are supposed to have priority over MM orders on marketable option and equity tickers, BUT, MMs and Citadel rather take your order ""hostage"" with their own order placed on your behalf with flags set on the trade that a retail customer cannot set on their order.

I've been trading GOOGL intraday calls and puts, and discovered that orders that I was competing against would fill before me, even though I was supposedly the first one on the books(read exchange) on that price. So what? you might say, ""you got unlucky"", no I, you, or anyone else getting buttfucked by Robinhood is not ""unlucky"". The vast, vast majority of option and equity exchanges operate on FIFO w/contingencies. FIFO(First in First Out) means the first person to put up their sell, and first person who put up the bid side will be matched with each other, there is no luck to who gets an order, it who put in that order first. Now ""w/contingencies"" is supposed to be in the retail traders benefit, because that states that, even if a MM places an order before a customer, the customer will still be first. But clearly if you ever traded options on Robinhood, you'd realize **that's not the fucking case.**

So what the heck is goin' on?

I've done many hours of research to come to this conclusion, but all it is my best educated guess, with my knowledge of option order routing. Nothing about how Citadel routes orders, their edge threshold or how much time they hold the orders before moving it somewhere else(read different MM) is all private due to game theory reasons.

I am going to assume that once your order hits Citadels PFOF screens, and they don't want to fill your order at the current price. They will fire an identical order on their end, to the exchange, on your behalf(while nullifying the original order), this removes the CUST order specification, and allows them to get you the worst possible fill, while still giving you the BBO. Certain MM flags exist that actually allow last priority of an order, and it's very possible that they place that on your order. This will 100% of the time have your order be the last one on the books before the bid or ask changes.

&#x200B;

[Last Priority MM Order Flag](https://preview.redd.it/ysbb0tefuwl61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82c2b29ec8bf7adb389dbe488748e4f25996b4c)

Why would they do this?

They edge themselves by positioning themselves a certain against your executed trade. You getting a shitty fill is Citadel getting an awesome fill. And that is vice versa, you getting an excellent fill is not as good(or shitty) for Citadel, or the MM who picks up your marketable option order. So Citadel wants good fills, and a good edge, so they have to fuck someone over to get that.

What can I do about it?

On other(read real) brokers, you can have your orders sent directly to your desired exchange, without sending directly to a market maker(a market maker can still fill the order on-the-screens), however your order will still have that holy CUST order specification. On Robinhood, there is nothing they can do unless they add execution options and options for specific order instructions, which they won't do.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - When buying options, Citadel likely puts your order on the screens on your behalf(instead of your original order from the app), doing this loses the CUST order specification, which gives your order priority over MMs, and customers trading on brokerages that can shoot orders directly on the exchange will have priority over you. That is the most probable reason as to why Robinhood's order routing is trash.

Sup bros.

I say bros because that's what you guys are to me. My brothers in the trenches.

I bought 20 shares of GME on Wednesday Jan. 27th.

I read the DD.

I threw money I could afford to lose and then I got played.

We all got played. Vlad and Citadel fucked us.

We might never get to the end of that story, but we all know that we got greased up and used like some fuck toy. Some more than others. (You're still on RH? wtf are you doing you're actually retarded)

Now its been a minute since that fateful day in January. We have been tested and tried by our friends, our family, the media but we held strong. We sat through WEEKS of 40$ lows. Waiting. Patiently. A flicker of hope still shone in the dark. You think we're selling now you greedy fucks?

Some of us drank piss.

Some of us got divorced.

But we all held.

We held each other like Jack held Rose while the mother fucking titanic sank to the bottom of the god damn ocean. Today was just the tip of that glorious penis shaped iceberg that took the whole ship down.

And we're not fucking letting go.

I'm not only here for my tendies.

I'm here for my brothers tendies.

I'm here for my wife's boyfriends tendies.

I'm here for every Rolex watch on every Citadel execs. wrist.

I'm here to suck Wall Street fucking dry and rub their nose in the god damn shit stained swamp that they call the financial system.

And as the system burns to the fucking ground, I'll be blasting god damn sea shanties in my Lambo.

At this point telling you guys to hold is literally useless. You guys know what the fuck to do because you've been doing it so long your hands have turned to diamonds.

To all my brothers,

See you on the moon.

12301,Wall Street Bets Kept me off Crack,m0s0qf,"I know this sub is flooded with these types of posts lately, but I thought I'd share my story.

7 months ago to (to the day) I was at my lowest low.  I barely remember this period due to benzo and alcohol abuse, but I had been homeless for a few weeks at that point.  I had abused crack previously but when I lost access to my bank account I was doing anything cheap.

Although not officially divorced my wife had kicked me out (can't blame her) and I had almost nobody willing to pull me out of the spiral.  During this period my daughter (black) kept asking ""where's daddy?  I want to see daddy"", it absolutely breaks my heart to think of what she went through.

Anyways my wife had emptied our joint bank account and I couldn't handle sleeping on the street sober.  I got to a shelter, and after somewhat getting cleaned up I was able to rent out my friend's garage and stock shelves at the Safeway.  But I was getting fairly depressed and would occasionally enter spirals of substance abuse, it seemed like a full relapse was right around the corner.

When sober, I spent most of my afternoons in the library, where I learned about you retards.  And once I remembered my IRA was still well stocked, I immediately began taking advice from some of you.  I couldn't believe it, the rush from day trading felt EXACTLY LIKE CRACK.  And the money I made was FAR more than a days work at safeway.

I was all in GME at 73, and can't convey to you how it felt to know I was going to be rich.  We're all going to be rich.  Thank all of you autists so much for helping me and helping each other!

Do all us a favor and head over to [PowerUp Rewards - Rewards Center | GameStop](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/rewards-center/) and sign up for $15 a year subscription, millions of new rewards members might look good on a balance sheet. 

Now the reason for the post; physical games are NOT going away. Why? Because they offer so much value in the re-sale world. Let me give an example, I own a Nintendo switch, in fact I own 2 (both bought at GameStop thank you) and I started playing Zelda Breath of the Wild. I made sure to buy the physical copy for one reason, I want to sell it back for trade in value when I’m done. Currently there is **no option for reselling games purchased virtually**, not even a plan. Why would anyone want to buy a virtual game? The short answer is some people are just lazy and want it now, but if I can buy Zelda for $80 and sell it on ebay/ offer up for $50 why would I ever buy virtual games?!?! Not everyone thinks about ROI, but I know most of you apes do. The resellers world is on fire and video games – even retro – are hot right now.

**TLDR; Volume, MACD, and Short Availability are all extremely bullish for GME. HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀.**

Hang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.

**Case 1 : VOLUME**

Look at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

Secondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)

 

**Case 2 : MACD**

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.

&#x200B;

[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)

&#x200B;

 

**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**

From last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

&#x200B;

[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)

&#x200B;

 

**Final Thoughts**

There are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or ""In The Money"". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.

This also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.

The technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL. Don't be scared with dips as long as the trend is your friend. **🚀🚀🚀🚀**",1615269057.0

[Short Interest GME](https://preview.redd.it/yaz7mrqpjvl61.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d3415e39a6c47df5cfeeb170829e6f8a7e80e5)

**Short Interest (SI)** image included indicates that shorts covering has helped but they are still at a low level meaning historically this is relatively the lowest amount of shares shorted this year.  There is still enough shorts to help the price action upward and also enough to give stability to this big increases if they call it quits.

**Implied Volatility (IV)** is up but the contract premiums during the first squeeze were significantly higher.  For example, on 1/29 the stock was around $325 and the contract costs were:

At The Money (ATM) strike $325 1 wk option cost about $125

Today....ATM strike $195 1 wk option cost about $30.

Two things, 1) there is much less IV b/c this was a much slower and methodical rise albeit still over a short time period.  2) Since options premiums are still relatively cheap around $30 ATM I think (correct if wrong) they are still affordable enough to continue pressuring a gamma squeeze.

Implied 1 wk move is 15% ($30/$200) +/-  based on the contract prices.  This is much better than the plus or minus 38% ($125/$325) +/- 1 wk move last time.

**Technicals.**  I don't look at technicals but I'm thinking this is one view you can add to your technical view about where there is support and what the options market is pricing in.  The idea of this **falling back to $100 isn't supported by the options market.**

**Edit:** I think this also shows that a short squeeze wasn't needed to get us where we are right now.  Which is good b/c if it's a gamma squeeze then it's repeatable as we just witnessed.",1615268546.0

I just wanted to thank you all from the bottom of my hearts. I had been following this sub for a few months before it got all of its recent traction and I am not afraid to say that GME was the first time I was ever bold enough to invest. Now being the retarded ape that I am I somehow managed to invest at 240 (on the major come down), and subsequently managed to drag my a average price per share down to 179. 

This was over a month ago, and I had to endure the horrendous weeks of everyone telling me how fucking stupid I was for wasting the small amount of money I had on this stupid stock. While I was prepared to lose the money I had invested, I won’t lie, being down 83% felt pretty shit.

Well today, it turned around. For the first time since buying the stock I have closed the day in the green. You guys stuck with it through all of the shit and humiliation and finally we are seeing the rewards we deserve. 

This army of apes might just be the greatest thing Reddit has ever produced and I could not be prouder to be holding my 7 damn shares.

Edit: this is not financial advice


As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.


First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.


Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.


This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.


Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves

They know we will always have many choices  when buying games online. What could possibly better for GameStop than creating life long, untold loyalty with all of us young, internet savvy investors? Plus all of the headlines, movies and the impact on pop culture. What an opportunity for Gamestop! I believe they have massive skin in the game and want to see this happen more than any of us.

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening again my fellow retards around the world

This is a followup on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/), in which I already announced i would do one, if there are people actually reading my post. Hope you are still interested.

**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**

1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.
2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u/Calithrix](https://www.reddit.com/u/Calithrix/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.

**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**

So lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u/Natural\_Profession\_8](https://www.reddit.com/u/Natural_Profession_8/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/).

And a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.

Also a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).

**Some other requirements for a squeeze**

* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:

1. 03/24 Earnings
2. 03/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)
3. find other possible catalysts in [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/) post. (couldnt link cause of WSB guidelines but just look at his Endgame post with a lot of Upvotes)

* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.
* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.

**Some final thoughts**

* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.
* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good 🦍🦍🦍 with 💎🤲 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight🚀🚀🚀), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. 🌚

Alright, here's take 2 of my attempt to create something for this board that has a decent chance of withstanding the poo flung at it:

I understand a lot of people don't care, but if you want to \*try\* and swim with the flow, consider tech. analysis more like a language the big boys use to move stuff. It rarely works 100% because people are emotional, but, at least it can provide and educated guess where to get on/off so you don't have to stomach days/weeks of being in the red.

It's still just a guess, but take a look at how it's playing out, not quite random is it.

Also, scrubs will ask ""oh, but you can take any 2 points and --"". No, that just shows you have no idea what this is so read up on it.

The daily high and daily lows are sacrosanct in trading. If you're gutsy enough you can buy the high and sell the low, but that's just being silly.

I had $140s, sold at $208 (fearing too eratic movement), and re-invested half at $177 and $170 (keeping more powder dry in case it tests the days lows again).

12537,Options Game on AMC is on FIRE right now!,m0nm3u," Alright fellow simians, I am hoping we are evolving enough to where we can begin talking specifics in terms of the options market on our beloved AMC. I know many are hesitant, fearing that if specific prices aren't reached by Friday, younger apes in the pack may grow scared and begin to doubt our journey. I am hoping by now we have done enough research on the market itself to now understand specific pricing goals and not be discouraged by them if the week doesn't go as planned.

TLDR: If you are like me and data makes your snake hiss, or your cat growl for my ape sisters, stick around. If you're going to pout and take your ball home if we happen to miss a target price come friday, GTFOH...Sorry for yelling, I still love you, (bro hug).

Alright so as a nerd at heart a good spread sheet to me can beat a free premium pornhub account especially when it's a spreadsheet about boosting our AMC and speeding up the count down to our moon launch.

As you should all know, the options market and corresponding weekly Gamma squeezes will help push our rocket towards the launch pad much quicker than just the buy and hold campaign. Now, options are a different breed and can burn young gun apes bad so I am not suggesting playing ""just the tip"" with them if you do not fully understand the risk. Think playing said game with a cigar cutter...

Anyways, options have huge impact on stock price as each contract is for 100 shares. So the more contracts that are sold by market makers, the more 100x shares they must purchase the following monday at market price if the contracts are exercised. This is the foundation of Gamma. If you're not tracking and want to learn more, please reach out. Seriously, I'm not a weirdo, I'm not offering you free candy out of a sketchy van, I just know that the smarter our pack gets and learns the game, the worse it is for the Hedge Fucks. I am not an advisor, so I will not and do not give advice, but I will give information and hypotheticals for my ape brothers and sisters to make their own decisions.

In an earlier post this weekend I commented on how absurd (good thing) the options game is right now on AMC. AMC is now has the 11th most active options contracts. Yes, AMC, movie theaters. If you don't get why that is unfucking believable you must have been fortunate enough to be in a coma during the wet fart on first date of a year that was 2020 thanks to the rona.

Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Now at a strike of 8, if market prices is at or above 8.79 the number of options ITM is 27,688 or 2,768,800 shares at stake... how would you feel about that if you were shorted on AMC? Personally, I'd be curled up under my desk crysterbating while sucking my other thumb...

Below is a table I made listing the price at which options are ATM and the number of contracts that would be ATM or ITM at strikes below these are for all contracts sold expiring Friday (3/12):

7.98: 43 options ATM 4300 shares

8.03: 615 options ATM 65,800 shares

8.04: 3604 options ATM 360,400 shares

8.05: 5735 options ATM 573,500 shares

8.14: 8,054 options ATM 805,400 shares

8.38: 12,358 options ATM 1,235,800 shares

8.79: 27,688 options ATM 2,678,800 shares

Now sharing this info is meant to help shareholders know the power of the options game and keeping the weekly monday Gamma cycle going. I haven't done the research for this past friday. But the 8.01 buzzer beater that left me needing to change my jocks two weeks ago gave us a 14.5% jump that following monday.

""But why then are we still hovering around 8?!?! I want more and I want it now! Wahhh!""

Well that's because the HFs still had ladder attack power to push things back down by week's end. You beloved apes buying more stonk and holding it is taking that power away slowly. The less shares they have for ladder attack bullshit the more/longer that monday gamma price spike will hold.

As you can see above, things are good at almost any price above 8. But the 8 dollar call had a 10,000+ increase in the number of contracts sold at that strike last week compared to the week prior, hence the more than double resulting power compared to 8.38 (which is an 8 call sold a while back at a premium of .38 a share)

So for me personally, and not advising anyone to bandwagon, I'm going to be cheering for 8.80 at Friday's close so those 27,688 contracts containing 2,768,800 shares are ITM.

But even if it doesn't quite make it, I'll still have a smile ear to ear as I know the options ITM below are still pretty damn powerful in the fight against douche bags like Gabriel Plotkin and the rest of the Hedge Fucks...",1615260098.0

Luckily I work at a good restaurant and they brought me back. I honestly kinda wish they hadn’t, as it’s been so stressful dealing with all the new rules and keeping people safe. Basically everything that could go wrong has gone wrong this year. You know the story, you probably lived it this year. But all of that changed in November when I saw the short squeeze post. 

It wasn’t immediate, but suddenly I had something to think about other than how awful life has been. I bought and sold and bought and sold and managed to lose like $60 on 40 shares over a few months and was done with GME. Then my belief was reaffirmed when it started climbing again. And I bought back in. Best decision of my life. 

I finally had a reason to wake up again. First it was just because it was a lifetime chance to make some cash, but it quickly grew into something indescribable. Everyone was talking about it, at work, at the store, my brother, literally everyone was talking about it. But they didn’t get. You all did. We all knew what was coming. We watched the storm building and raised our sails, trusting that if enough fucking retards did it too the wind would be manageable and we could sail to Valhalla, leaving the dock Wall Street aflame. 

I guess it comes full circle again today. The squeeze popped off again on a day that could’ve left me crippled but it’s pulled my out. I know that it’s all coincidence, but damn if it doesn’t feel good. You all have changed my life and made me believe in something again.

# IS GE THE SAME AS GME?

Not the same, but share some similar characteristics

* Both stock have been beaten down into oblivion (See comparison chart below)
* Before DFV, who the fuck invests in GME? Now, who the fuck invests in GE?
* Both stock have HIGH upside when it is consolidating at the bottom
* Both stock have special external conditions that make it an interesting R / R play
* GME was over shorted and had fresh talent take over from CHEWY
* GE  is in a special moment in US history when an Infrastructure Bill by the  Gov could pave the way for a turnaround for General Electric (more on  that later)

1. Power - energy production services.
2. Renewable  Energy - wind turbine platforms, hardware and software, offshore wind  turbines, products and services to hydropower industry, blades for wind  turbines, and high voltage equipment.
3. Aviation - jet engines and turboprops for commercial airframes, maintenance, component repair, and overhaul services.
4. Healthcare  - technologies in medical imaging, digital solutions, drug discovery,  biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies and performance enhancement  solutions.
5. Financial  services segment (Capital) - leases and finances aircraft, aircraft  engines and helicopters, and provides financial solutions.

>**WSB RETARDS:** “BUT [/u/fattybrah](https://www.reddit.com/u/fattybrah/) GE is boomer garbage and have been a dumpster fire for years! Why would I buy this piece of shit?”  
>  
>**FATTYBRAH:** “Take a look at GME, it was a piece of shit and everyone laughed at [/u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE](https://www.reddit.com/u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE/)  until it started running from the BOTTOM. The harder a stock is beaten  down, the higher the upside (assuming your analysis is correct and the  right conditions exists)“

# TECHNICALS

My  primary reasoning for this bet is in the charts, which are  self-explanatory with pretty crayon coloring. I’ve simplified it  tremendously and only highlighted important stuff.

[GE vs GME \(Monthly TF\)](https://preview.redd.it/9q2f9r21aul61.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb05bbcd85d1ba6ac24b168d47e9406148c39cf)

[GE \(Monthly TF\)](https://preview.redd.it/4qg7qt72aul61.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=5063367659ff3797007d18a157935c7de4fda54b)

[GE \(Daily TF\)](https://preview.redd.it/rak6yez2aul61.png?width=2269&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ea4f6c9d35ef6d34195017ac0902cd79d347529)

# (SPECULATIVE) FUNDAMENTALS

Aside  from the technical, I’m also BETTING that the Post Pandemic era is  going to send this stock back up to test previous highs.

1. Pandemic - For obvious reasons, people getting sick and dying increases demand in the entire healthcare sector.
2. Post Pandemic – Travel industry will recover, which means GE Aviation demand will rise
3. US  Power grid issues – GE is the OG in this space (remember Edison General  Electric Company? I don't). They laid the foundation for America’s  power grid back before our great grandparents were hipsters.

`SPECULATION ON INFRASTRUCTURE BILL`–JPOW and his goons are on a printing spree. With California fires the  last 6 years and Texas power grid chaos this year, it is OBVIOUS (to me)  we need to UPGRADE OUR POWER GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. What better way to do  that than to inject TRILLIONS into the sector through an INFRASTRUCTURE  BILL, which not only addresses our power problem but generate jobs and  get America back on it’s feet? This means an upgrade to our power grid  to provide more reliable power when we need it the most (i.e weather  extremities) with an emphasis on sustainability and being more eco  friendly (Greta probably approves) . GE is poised to be the biggest  player for this task as they have the capacity and experience to do the  job. On a side note, if an infrastructure bill passes, it’ll be more  than GE that benefits from the bill.

I'm all over GME and AMC but this one looks primed for liftoff! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

What I do not understand is why this thing keeps getting shorted? Does someone understand how a foundational company like this can continue going down while everything else spikes? It now hits both the short squeeze territory and fundamentally a good company. Inflation would be the only logical thing I have read that would cause this but it's competitor RKT is not being affected.

12963,Why AMC is a definite buy and should be skyrocketing like GME.,m0j1yl,"You see....

Everyone is losing their minds..

Oh no. The internet is taking over! The stream wars is upon us! Obi One Stay Homie because of the pandemic...

Yeah yeah yeah.

Your forgetting key fundamentals to the current film industry though!

You see. Movie theaters....
They sell you an experience!
You wait in line with a bunch of ganja scented slackers in front of you and that weird guy with his mom behind you. You get your 🎟, and immediately your babe is like, I want popcorn and raisinettes. So you spend $40 on some snacks and drinks and you go in this super dark room with a bunch of strangers and nothing but a kid with a broom and an endless supply of gum for security.

You, hopefully, were smart enough to pick out some dope seats. You watch some movie theatre exclusive commercials, and you enjoy watching the movie and reacting with the crowd during scenes where gasps and laughs are acceptable. You finish, stick around for post scene credits, and leave your shit on the ground like its your first time getting laid.

What am I getting at here?!

Lets take a worst case scenario. Disney, Paramount and everyone else in the world says 'go screw yourself"" to AMC. They get no new movies. Ever again.

""Yo, general public!"" Shouts out AMC! ""Were hosting a Marvel Avengers marathon for the next 35 days! Every fucking movie released by Marvel since 1913, we are playing, come check it out!""

You like the Dark Night? We got that.

Ever wondered why Frozen is just the Lion King rehashed into a Disney Princess for the fan girls who don't give a fuck about Mufasa? We will play them back to back with a live rendition of Macbeth an enlighten you to the truth!

AMC has so many movies, they could create a monthly subscription for you to go out and watch old shit on the big screen and rake in 50 times the profits they currently do for the next 1000 years!

UUHHHHAAAaaaMmmMCCccCccc is tanking...

Shut up! Your all bad apes that need to hold and work them diamond hands.

So a few weeks ago when i was doing DD for GME I was checking a bunch of stocks that were heavily shorted, and UTZ was 55% shorted (sorry, no screenshots). So I started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in August and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much? I for the most part just passively observed it for a bit. Fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6% so I look at the stock and it dropped from 25.89 to 23.35 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UTZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UTZ) 

So now that the short is over, I wondered if it is a good time to invest in it (my money is tied up in GME but if I had funds available) so I went to the call options to see what they had going on there and I found 7,347 call options for $30 a share as well as 1,092 @$25

so I think this is not a guarantee but I think it would be a good safe investment with almost immediate returns. plus there isn't too much risk because this company has been doing very well since it hit the market.

I recently ate a few of the copper-colored crayons out of a 96-pack, and I'm pretty sure they're laced with Ritalin because I then proceeded to read Kurt Vonnegut's 1959 classic *The Sirens of Titan,* in which he lays out what I can only describe as the most perfect DD I have ever seen. Since I know you don't have books and probably sold all your metallic crayons to buy more $GME (respect), I will lay out the plan for you.

In the book, the main character is the son of a great man, Noel Constant. Noel Constant is a great man, because he turned $8,200 into the largest fortune in the world. How?

He lived in a motel, which contained a copy of the Gideon Bible in the desk drawer. First, he took the first few sentences of that Bible and split it into stonk tickers. So ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"" became IN, TH, EB, EG, IN, NI, NG...

Next, he invested all $8,200 into the first stonk, IN, in the list. And what did he do then?

He held. 

He placed a goddamn limit order for double his investment. He didn't fucking paperhands when his stonks were worth 10k. Or 12k. He diamond-handed all the way up to $16,400, and then pulled out all his sweet, sweet tendies.

And then what did he do?

He turned around and put ALL of it into the next one on his list. $16,400 into TH. Which he held until it turned into $32,800.

You get the idea. 

Now, unfortunately there is no ""IN"" ticker. But there is an ""INT"" ticker. World Fuel Services Corp. Which has a strong cashflow and is poised to start making some big gains once people start flying and traveling again. Or so the internet says; it doesn't actually matter since Noel Constant didn't know a fucking thing about his companies when he invested--it's not until he had majority ownership of a company that made spaceships that he started giving a shit about what they actually did. And we ain't at that stage yet.

So here's the play:
1) Invest in INT
2) Diamond Hands until 100% return
3) Sell 
4) Invest into HE
5) Diamond Hands until 100% return
6) Sell
7) Repeat 1-3 for BE, GI, NN, ING, GO, DC, RE, AT...

Even if this plays only half as well as it does in the book, I will be flying around the solar system in a year or two. But I fully expect it to be far more lucrative; after all real life is far stranger than fiction. 

Disclaimer: I'm an ape who read a book. This is not financial advice from me or Kurt Vonnegut. You want financial advice, read your wife's bf's diary

EDIT: I'm poor, so I only have $820 instead of $8,200. But it's now all in INT: 22.77 shares @ $36 LETS GO",1615201578.0

&#x200B;

First off, I want it made clear that I have very little knowledge about data analytics and my opinions are my own and you may believe them if you would like.

I've noticed in recent days that there has been much discussion surrounding PLTR about how they are a good buy due to insider selloffs, general market downtrend, Cathy Wood, Alex Karps Hair, etc. However there has been little discussion about exactly why their technology is such a big deal, and I believe its mostly due to people not understanding the techno babble on their website combined with not understanding the vague but nice sounding reasons listed by other people that coincidentally, also don't understand why PLTR is a big fucking deal. This is unfortunately expected since the breadth and scale of What PLTR's technologies can do is difficult to put into words, metaphors, or anything simple enough for you monkey shits to understand.

I however don't give a fuck and so will try anyway.

Everyone knows already that Palantir does things with data analytics, and organizes it or presents it in a way that **helps companies make better more informed choices.** so what's the big deal then? don't other companies do something similar?

well yes, but not really. The difference with Palantir is while other companies collect and store data, analyze it, and maybe create software that specializes in something related to it, what Palantir does is they take all that data, they analyze it, maybe make some software, and uses it to create (and this is extremely dumbed down) ***a virtual simulation of whatever you are trying to copy***. Palantir's capable of taking anything you want a simulation of, your network, your logistical systems, financial systems, entire business operations, anything that can be connected with large quantities of data, and makes a fucking copy on the computer that behaves and reacts like the real thing would. you can test ideas, check for problems, cause problems just to see what happens, and all while constantly changing and evolving in tandem with the real thing. If that isn't already enough, this simulation also is able to proactively suggest solutions to problems that are calculated to have the BEST POSSIBLE RESULT. This in turn, **helps companies make better more informed choices.** you see what I did there? the end conclusion is the same as what everyone else is coming to, but the problem is people aren't getting just how big a deal it is.

If you dimwit dumbshits still don't get it somehow, consider this.

Imagine if you worked at Melvin and Co. Now imagine you had the power to look into an hourglass that showed you a magical parallel dimension. NAY every possible parallel universe in which Melvin exists! and upon this hourglass you asked, ""Mr. hourglass, what would happen if we shorted the FUCK out of GME?"" the hourglass would peer into all possible realties, find the ones where GME is short, measure how many became succesfull and how many failed, and would say

""oof. hang in there""

That's what PLTR does. (well sort of its hard to explain)

Should you throw your entire life savings directly into this bad boy? absolutely fucking not. I'm not your financial adviser/daddy and cannot and will not tell you what to do.

that being said, who's gonna stop you?

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

   
 

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.


SOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?



Well, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

   
 

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

   
 

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.

   
 

NOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

   
 

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

   
 

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

   
 

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

   
 

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

   
 

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.

   
 

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

   
 

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

   
 

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

   
 

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.

   
 

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

   
 

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

   
 

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.

   
 

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

   
 

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.

   
 

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

   
 

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.

   
 

I just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

   
 

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

   
 

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

   
 

THATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.

   
 

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)

   
 

   
 

   


EDIT:

Seriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.

I was hanging around on Yahoo GME call options, with my red pen deep in my nose, shifting from date to date... 

When I’ve just noticed 100K written PUT on 0.5 USD on GME for.... 01/22/2022 e.g. +9 months from now on.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1642723200&amp;amp;guccounter=1

What’s the purpose of this?

* unmeaningful strike price 
* unmeaningful open interest

Now let’s consider the impact on underlying stock buy/sell strategy, following a standard delta-neutral strategy from market maker.

The delta of put is negative i.e. the slope is negative. When the stock price gain 1$, the OTM put option premium decreases, let’s say by 0.5$. 

Buying a put thus gets a -0.5 delta. Conversely, selling a put as a market maker provides a +0.5 delta.

To achieve **delta-neutral** hedging, the market maker thus needs to **sell** stocks.

Can we here have a hidden shorting strategy from hedge funds - along with shorted ETF?

With an estimated delta of -0.20 e.g +1$ in stock implies -0.2$ in OTM put premium, and each option being set on 100 shares, it represents a total delta to cover of...

100,000 * -0,2 * 100

**2M additional shares to short** for this deep OTM cheap put on 01/22/2022

Edit: I do **not** think delta is overrated and put is too far OTM, please check 12$ strike at 1.80 premium and 10$ strike at 1.40 premium e.g. 0.20 effective delta

In fact, I don't recommend reading it. I may have eaten too many yellow crayons I thought were bananas this week (Or was I trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas? Idr) but I think I stumbled onto something.

Most people on this sub are Millenials (speculation). Most Millenials grew up playing video games. We have a passion for them. But we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games. *Until now*.

As we all know, Robinhood and similar apps **game-ified** investing. They made cool colors to show us how we did. It's not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on. So we could say ""Ohhhh green good red bad."" It's like the slot machine except, unlike slots, investing odds can be changed by doing work. Nobody used to do the work, but now that all the work is on the phone--the same device we have been using to play the game--it still feels like part of the game. 

So we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game. It's like when you play StarCraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at StarCraft. Well, we read posts on GME and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock. 

Why are video games even fun? None of it is real. But it's a **shared** experience that you can have with your friends and peers, or, at the very least, discuss with them. It's the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level, even though it's all fake. Well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real. Sure, it's all documented, but it's still virtual. Nobody's going to your bank and moving cash into RH's bank. This all works because we all agree that it works.

Now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even, for some of us, practicing, and you've got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing.

Am I making any sense or am I insane even for a WSBer?

Now that the world is slowly reopening with Covid still around, all eyes are on ways to reduce ways for the virus to spread. That's why I'm thinking about placing a bet on air purifier manufacturers.

A Dutch scientist found that those machines filter around 90% of aerosols out of the air during studies in a gym, an American article even puts it at 99,9%. So I think there's going to be a huge run on these filters.

(and maybe even legislation demanding them to be present in public buildings when it turns out the virus is indeed spread by aerosols, judgement is still out on that one)

&#x200B;

1. OIL calls / shares -- sell end of summer / beg of fall. Generationally cheap --- with re-opening AND constrained supply due to all of the green initiatives, we should see a major runup of oil prices.
2. FINANCIAL calls, in particular I like WFC due to cheap calls. It was in the 50s before COVID reared its ugly head.
3. BABA - beat down by Xi's cockhammer but still absolutely dominant in China. It's the best undervalued tech name (even better than FB in my opinion). BABA also is heavily invested in the China start-up ecosystem, so should do well even with more-than-expected regulation (which I find unlikely)

**Why I like these plays:**

These plays should do well in all 2021 environments.

* Inflation fears due to overstimulus? Oil and financials will do great while BABA, given how cheap it is, will be flat.
* Inflation fears overblown yet reopening moves forward? All 3 should do extremely well.
* New COVID strain renders current vaccines useless -- BABA will do well and oil/financials will be flat. This is just unlikely to happen, boyz. Even with new variants things will continue to open up.

The only way to lose money is if we have a zombie apocalypse.

&#x200B;

**Positions**

1. WFC:  June 50c or 45c and sold 4/16 puts to pay for the calls. 1000 shares.
2. BABA: 710 shares -- no options as I don't have a good thesis on WHEN it will moon.
3. XOM, OXY, CPE, MRO, MPC -- various shares and options with different strikes from next month through August. Also selling puts to pay for the calls. 200k into it overall.

I know many of you are more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.

# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain 🦍)

There are two types of squezzes:

* short squezze
* gamma squezze

**Short squezzes:**

Evil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/).

**Gamma squezzes:**

Evil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.

If you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.

What you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.

# Applying this to the current GME situation

**Short squezze:**

Im sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).

^(1: 01/14/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

^(2: 02/11/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

*""But there was no volume?"".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.

^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)

^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN)

*""But what is with the institutional ownership?""* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said ""Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest."" (e. g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.

^(5:) [^(Finra)](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)

With that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.

^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https://etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

**Gamma squezze:**

A gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.

*So how can 🦍🦍🦍 profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.

^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)

*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:

>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  
>  
>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*

So these are probably numbers we need to see again.

^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)

*So whats the current situation with GME options?*

For the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.

^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)

&#x200B;

[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\/12](https://preview.redd.it/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)

But for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.

&#x200B;

[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03\/19](https://preview.redd.it/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb)

I may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.

And of course no financial advice!

EDIT: Someone in the comments has pointed out that I actually misspelled Squeeze. Sorry for that. So you see Im also just an 🦍, who cant write.

"" Asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy, Powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the Fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market, among other conditions. ""It’ll take some time to get there,” he said, noting that inflation is also running well below the Fed’s 2% target""

**Section 1: ""HyPeR-iNfLaTiOn Is CoMiNg!""**

Let's go back to some basics. Thanks to our current banking system, we live in a debt-based society where our goal is to pull out a loan for 5% interest and make 420.69% gains. Now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie, so now we have a problem. For example, I have 100 tendies and you have 100 bananas and we decide a 1:1 tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good. All of a sudden, fucking Chad McDonkeyKong says he has 200 bananas and he wants to trade with me. So now we have 300 bananas in circulation and only 100 tendies. I now agree that the exchange rate is 1:3 tendies to bananas and now you're down 66% on your banana trade. Fucking Chad...

That's inflation for you. More money is added into circulation, and therefore you need **more** of it to buy the same goods.

Now let's say your girlfriend gets pissed at Chad McDickFace for putting too many bananas in the banana market (why would she? LOL), so he pulls out 100 bananas. Now with 200 bananas in circulation and 100 tendies, the exchange rate is 1:2 tendies to bananas. Guess who just made tendies? Fuck ya you did! Now you're only down 50% from when Chad entered the market.

That's deflation for you. Money is removed from circulation and there you need **less** of it to buy the same goods.

Ya, I know that already, retard! Get to the point!

If we look at the US's monetary base (blue) and the Fed's balance sheet (red) you can clearly see there's a lot more bananas in circulation. INFLATION!!!

Not quite... Economists use CPI (consumer price index) to collect information about pricing on goods, services and loans in the economy. It's got some flaws, but it's been reliable enough to account for inflation for the last few hundreds of years, so we'll stick with this as our metric.

See that majestic Big Black ~~Dick~~ Arrow? We call that steady inflation and the Fed like's this around 2% Year over Year (YoY) for ""optimal market and economic growth and stability"". I recall hearing 2 - 3% is about the average that most growing societies experienced as well, so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate. So what does it mean? In order to stay ahead of all the new Chads pulling out loans and YOLO'ing you need to increase your net worth by **at least** this amount per year. Real returns are when you factor in taxes on assets/gains and this tend to lower it.

Anyhow, let's see what the data says about inflation and QE:

Meh...?

**Section 2: ThIs TiMe Is DiFfErEnT**

Okay, so what the fuck?? We're on 4 rounds of QE and no hyper inflation... I thought the FED was an infinite money glitch? So how does this QE, infinite money pinata work?

First of all, **QE IS A SUM ZERO EXCHANGE.** It's primary objective is to drive interest rates on treasury securities to 0% and thereby decrease interest rates the bank can loan at (home loans, credit card loans, etc...). So how does it work?

It's something like this. Primary dealer (bank?) goes to the bond market, looking for some tendies. Normally they would only buy $10 worth of tendies, but Papa JPow is mother fucking huuuungray, so they buy $60 worth of tendies each time they go shopping. This is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply, but it doesn't (the US will only be issue so much debt), so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit. So over time, we'll start to see a supply shortage (remember, bonds are retarded, so **when the price goes up, interest rates and yields go down.** Fucking magic). JPow is trying to forcing a MOTHER FUCKING SUPPLY SHORTAGE in bond market.

So what's JPow doing with these gay bonds? See, daddy JPow is worried that these little bitch ass banks (JPM, WFC, etc...) are going to go full retard again, like in 2008, so he's shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until we're back to normal. In exchange for the $50 tendies, he's giving these ass hats $50 cash so they can keep jerking each other off, as long as they don't YOLO it into the markets and economy, life is good. Daddy JPow also knows he can keep doing this QE trick until bond prices go to infinity, but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with...

Now, at the same time these smaller banks aren't as retarded as we think they are, and they also don't want to fail like in 2008 and they've learned a thing or two. Sure Papa JPow can throw money at them again, but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time. So, the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy JPow for some easy gains. They also know many of us are fucked without jobs, so why even risk lending right now?

So banks are buying bonds, JPOW has a safe, and banks aren't lending... Nothing new here...

Well, the take away here is that all that money JPow is printing is STUCK in the banks and the banks don't want to lend it out. A good way to show this is the M2 Velocity, which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed. It's like this: Monkey A borrows banana from Chad McShittyAss. Monkey A buys tendies off Monkey B. Monkey B gives banana back to Chad. In this case, the banana went from C -> A -> B -> C. Since Chad created the banana and destroyed the banana, he doesn't count, in the transaction, so it's just A & B that matter. In this case the M2 velocity would be 2.0. Now let's look at how QE affects us:

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=BDgP ](https://preview.redd.it/plzgaux0r5l61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca546e26a8055786997e2da50e5ba60423d15e3)

We're currently sitting at an abysmal 1.13 in the M2V right now, compared to an average of 1.76 we from the 60's until the 90's. So that means people aren't spending. **We're in a dollar shortage.**

Well, no shit! We can't go anywhere and buy shit!!

Yep and to top it off, banks are still not lending with all that jerk off money they got from Papa JPow. Any time the Blue line is above the black one, it means **banks are tightening lending restrictions.** As you can see, banks are still tightening their lending right now. Smart people are paying off debt right now, but **this destroys money** in the process.

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=qw94 https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/data\/sloos\/sloos-202101-table-1.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/zknji3l3r5l61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec0f08126076a77e1b339d4fe294d7ff4fecf9fe)

Okay Jerk-off-osaurus\_Rex, I JUST WANT TENDIES! HOW DO I FIND TENDIES!?

Okay, so if banks aren't lending (disinflationary), people are sitting on cash (disinflationary) and smart people are paying down debt (deflationary), where's the inflation coming from? Actually, it's all speculation.

[https:\/\/hedgopia.com\/cot-peek-into-future-through-futures-how-hedge-funds-are-positioned-196\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/vzs75rq6r5l61.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4dda87881983a0987e4734f5360affe995c12eb)

See that red line? That's the interest rate on 30y bonds (inverse the price). We want it to go down. See those little green marks, those are short positions, they make it go up. Last year saw the **LARGEST short position in the bond market. EVER**. You know Papa JPow with his infinite money glitch, he wants the red line to go down. Sweet, **we have the FUCKING FEDERAL RESERVE on our side**! You know who hates shorts more than Elon, Cohen or Our RKT Crew? The FUCKING FED. Since the dollar is tied to treasuries, popping the shorts will also cause the **dollar to rally.**

You know who hates the dollar to rally? Fucking everyone. Stock prices drop, Gold prices drop, Oil prices drop, it's harder to trade internationally... Yep... **JPow is a huge fucking bear**. Your calls are actually fukt.

So how do we profit off JPow?

Full gay bear style (when the time is right of course). Macro can be slow as shit to play out, so leaps or shares are the game. Timing is hard for this shit, but JPow is HUUUNGRY for them bondies.

The most obvious monies to be had: long $TLT (30y bonds), Cash is fine too! (just follow $UUP for a rally), Inverse $GDX. I dunno, I'm sure you other gay bears have some fetishes out there that will compliment a dollar rally.

What to stay away from: Inflation protected Bonds (this is tied to the CPI and you'll lose money if our economy eats shit). Probably companies with large negative cash flow when shit hits the fan. You know, the usual recession shit.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.

TLDR: What the fuck did I just read? So much gear bear shit in here dude... What the actual fuck?

a) QE hasn't lead us to hyper inflation, banks still aren't lending and other countries are deflating right now, so **deflation is the real enemy.**

b) JPow is trying to cause **a supply shortage in the bond market (bond prices go upsies)**

c) JPow or the economy are going to pop the shorts on the 30y and cause the markets to melt down.

d) When JPow does ""The Twist"", that's when he'll start buying 30y's :)

Simple spreadsheet of the stocks I track showing max, min, and avg stock price for 2021, current price, and % of potential gains if the stock returns to the average or max.  I'm using this to narrow the field of stocks to research before investing my soon-to-be GME gains.  Max, min, and current are all closing prices - made it much easier to compile.

There are some outliers, so DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Some are dipping hard because of the company, not just because the markets dipping.  Some stocks have current prices below the min, so they may continue to drop.  This sheet is not investment advice or meant to be used by itself.  If you see something you like, dig deeper.

The list doesn't capture a lot of big stocks, so if you want me to add something let me know.

First post, so feel free to rip me to shreds.

Edit #2: added a bunch of tickers

Edit #3:  Thanks for the awards!  if they arent free, throw em at GME. 

Clarification on the Max shown on the sheet - its the high since Jan 4 2021, not the ATM.  some might be the same though.

Also taking your suggestions and working on a sheet that captures all stocks so you can easily see whats lower than avg, above avg, at the YTD high, etc.  hope to have this rolled out in the next couple weeks.  then can update it weekly to see what changes have happened.",1614945504.0

Listen guys, don't just buy stocks because it's on WSB, do your own DD (Due Diligence) beforehand. With that being said, if you do your DD on UWMC, you'll see this stock is unique with a great future ahead of itself.

Please refer below:

$UWMC - I truly like this stock.

Quick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall.

Short Interest - I see a lot of people talking about short interest and short float percentage and don't seem to quite understand it completely. If there's a short interest of %10 thats considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater thats considered extremely high. When GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. With that aside, here are some current updates on the short percentages of UWMC, GME, AMC, RKT.

UWMC - 28% as of 03/03/2021

GME - 26% as of 03/03/2021

AMC - 14% as of 03/03/2021

RKT - 17% as of 03/03/2021

Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $64.40 - Currently going for $10.00.

\*\* This has been pointed out by u/bbwasawesome that SWS has updated their fair value to $19.78. This makes sense as this stock is valued anywhere between $20-$60 in a normal market.\*\*

UWMC is Americas leader in underwriting loans and mortgages. They have differentiated themselves from their competitors by having their business create the fastest and most effective consumer to lender process to be qualified/approved for their mortgage application and be provided the best competitive rates.  UWMC doesn't ""Lend"" any funds, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they provide institutions, lenders, and consumers is a simple process they can use to apply, compare, and complete a mortgage application. Their system and software is proprietary to UWMC and institutions such as small banks, credit unions, brokers, and lenders use it because it reduces time & cost on a multitude of spectrums and the process is much quicker; meaning closing applications faster equates to higher revenue for institutions and Lenders. The whole process is completed through UWMC from consumer to lender, and provides enormous benefit to both B2C and B2B.

You look me in the eye right now and tell me you have a hard time seeing this? 👀👀👀

Mods please make this a serious thread. Thanks.

\*I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is some lightweight DD to be used to provide the community with some insight on UWMC\*

\*To all the negative comments, yes my username is ShortChecker, I thought it was unique and it also wasn't taken. Where did the idea come from? The enormous amount of ridiculously shorted stocks, literally was that basic. Second, to all GME 💎🖐, I wish you the best and I hope to see you on the moon! 🚀✊. As mentioned in the post, this is just my lightweight DD on a stock and is only here to provide insight and for you to do your own DD and make your own informed decision. I also can't reply to comments due to the new rules in WSB, hence, why I'm writing this in an edit on the post. I hope all traders and investors get that ticket to the moon, one way or another. 🚀🌔\*

 Today we just briefly broke the 144.80 on the daily candles, and there's a good chance it now explodes into the next previous larger candle between the orange lines of 170.79 and 186.58.

I don't see as many posts, or as many comments regarding the DD or discussions on the potentials AMC poses as a short squeeze target. It's sad to see how many of you disbanded for quick bucks on other shit tickers. 

Here are some cold facts about AMC:

1. AMC Short Interest is now a whopping +10%
2. The OI on options expiring 3/19 are ENORMOUS. The value is nearly HALF that of Apples.
3. AMC is still a massively shorted stock, one of the most in the whole market. 
4. AMC is reopening dozens and dozens of cinemas tomorrow in many cities: one of the biggest being in San Francisco.
5. The fucking FUNDAMENTALS haven't changed! AMC & GME have ALWAYS been the cause. We LIKE these stocks. 

>inb4 here are bearish hard cold facts on AMC.

I just came back today from the cinema for the first time in a long ass time. And it felt GREAT. The feeling of having people laugh alongside you, the thrill of grabbing popcorn and sinking into the leather chairs, watching a new release on a big screen. Fuck the Netflix. That's for lazy zoomers who want instant depressing gratification. So fuck the bearish sentiment on AMC. I don't care. I support our cinemas with my cash, and will fucking HOLD until you apes eventually come back to your original mission. 

TLDR: Everyone seems to have forgotten about AMC to chase quick bucks on PLT, RKT, SKX and other shit tickers and have forgotten where they began. AMC is still not done. It never really began in the first place, yet. Stay the course.",1614936354.0

So recently I was thinking..

Hedge funds want to protect themselves from a future GME incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through WSB and see what stocks are gaining momentum. The problem is that it’s extremely easy to parse through Reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned. So, I was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots (potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies) 

Why don’t we create a program that converts text to images that can’t be parsed so easily.. kind of like a captcha system that bots can’t easily win. This will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage. As we know timing is essential here. 

Obviously, it’s easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through WSB and find the next stock that gains momentum; but that takes significantly more time; there has to be a solution here too .. I just don’t know what it is.

Whatever the case, I WONT be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through Reddit to protect themselves. Let’s at least give them a major headache!


Edit: sharing ideas on a forum shouldn’t be illegal. Algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be ILLEGAL. I want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over. That’s all I’m saying.

Edit #2: Potentially we can use ReCaptcha something that’s has been out for a long time (Google has developed this over many years) before allowing access to any DD.

Edit #3: I really like this suggestion by /u/TheLegendDevil: “One way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker. Easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about.”",1614935314.0

Second of all, this is about RKT. Don't like it? Don't care. GME is cool. I like GME, but I don't like eating just purple crayons. I like the blues and the yellow ones too. 

I was looking at the RKT options chain when I noticed this:

https://imgur.com/a/7CeFjbW

Now to my eye, as of the current price, that looks like quite a few options that are ITM RIGHT now.

With all the news about the special dividend, the billion dollar buyback, the CEO's pure hatred of shorts, and UWMC's war on RKT, I think that RKT just may, just could, pop up again.

RKT is currently STILL undervalued even with the revised (and suspect) price target of $30 and the attention is now fully on it after the recent spike into the $40's.

This looks RIPE for a gamma squeeze again.

13293,Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,lxzyzn,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",1614934036.0

My Dad spent 20 years of his life working at GE oakville ON fixing machines that assembled incandescent light bulbs. It was a great job that paid well and put food on our families tables, that was until the Ontario LIBERAL government made a transition into the crappy mercury lightbulbs, thereby shutting down the GE plant and leaving my father without a job just around the time of the 2008 crash. In the past GE has been very successful and have many many years of successful operation. 

March 10th 2021 GE is hosting their 2020 4th Q webcast where they plan to announce a new direction for the company to be headed towards. It is my thinking GE can continue to be a big name player in many sectors of economy and be innovators and supply the world and other big companies with reliable tech, medication, and innovations down the line. 

ATM it is the 2nd most shorted stock in the industrial conglomerates but only (est 1.08 billion shorted) 1.46% of the float so it wont be the next gamestop.

13336,"GME vs VW Squeeze, NOT THE SAME! But I also like the stock 🙌💎🚀",lxyf6b,"TLDR: VW's squeeze was very different to the coming GME squeeze and people should be careful of some maybe false promises here. 

Hello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up:

Just recently one particular post/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. 

Yes but....WRONG! 

I don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you:

(Translated from german Wikipedia):

""An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. [1] On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.""

In Short:

Porsche had 74,1%

Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony - 😂😂), a ""state"" of Germany had 20%

So the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. 

What's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: 

There are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price/planned sell price/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. 

Thats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. 

To give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. 

However I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$

Since I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock!

...Made 5k€ at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100€ 💎🙌🚀

... Please correct me if I am totally wrong here.",1614929241.0

13346,🦍🍌👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 Lesson #1: How Market Makers Make Money: an emoji story,lxy5c4,"You're a 🦍who's hungry for a 🍌. However, thanks to the deforestation around the world (estimated 18.7 million acres are felled each year) gorillas, bonobos, chimpanzees and orangutans don't have any 🍌🌴 to pick their food from. So what's an 🦍gotta do ?!

Emoji Guide: 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 = Market Maker 🦍🦍 = Investors 🍌🍌 = Stocks 🏹🏹 = Brokerage / Market

# Chapter 1:

You round up your pals 🦍🦍🦍 and you head to the 🏹🏹 market so you can buy some 🍌🍌🍌from the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾.

The 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 set the price for the 🍌🍌. In order for the 🏹🏹 market to be able to meet the demand of the 🦍🦍 there needs to be liquidity so that any 🦍🦍is capable of buying a 🍌🍌 as they please. Consider if you wanted to sell your house, it's not likely that you would be able to sell it instantly. In terms of the equity markets, this is where 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 play a role. In order to be able to buy or sell 🍌🍌someone has to be on the other side of that deal. 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾around the globe provide liquidity on all of the major exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, Japan Exchange Group, etc.)

# Chapter 2

So you want to buy 100 🍌🍌 and you'll notice there is a bid price and an ask price.

🍌🍌bid = $10

🍌🍌ask = $12

spread = $2

For the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 the bid of $10 is what they BUY the 🍌🍌for and $12 is what they SELL the 🍌🍌 to 🦍🦍for.

Now we all know that 🦍🦍have 💎👐 but let's say that the price of 🍌🍌have gone up to $420.69 and you'd like to sell some of those 🍌🍌. Well the price that you sell for will be the bid price for the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 and if some more 🦍🦍 come along and want to buy those $420.69 🍌🍌 the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾will sell those to the new 🦍🦍 at the ask price. So let's simplify this and get rid of the $420.69 price and use the original numbers of $10 and $12.

# Chapter 3

🦍🦍 buys 🍌🍌 from the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 at the ask price of $12.

🙉 makes a mistake and sells 🍌🍌 to the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 for $10.

🦧 comes along and buys the 🍌🍌 that the 🙉🧻👐mistakenly sold to the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 for $12.

👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 just made $2

🦍+ 🦧 have 💎👐

🙉 has 🧻👐

Now that we understand how Market Makers work, let's take a look at how 🧛 (Vlad) makes money on his brokerage 🏹 (RH).

As you can see below, all of those 🍌🍌that get traded back and forth bring in a lot of revenue for the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾, who are paying 🧛🏹 for the privilege of being their Market Makers. Given the massive influx of retail investing in the past year, it makes sense that the revenue would be increasing here.

In a nutshell....The 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 are paying 🧛🏹 to be the ones who can profit off of the 🙉 🧻👐.

In the case of 🧛🏹 the Market Maker is 🏰 (Citadel Securities).

Order Flow by Brokerage.

This is a somewhat oversimplification of what happens, but in order to create an easy to understand outline of what is happening, I can't add every single detail of what is happening. Hopefully this helps some of you understand what's going on when you click the ""Buy"" or ""Sell"" (lol 🙉 🧻👐) button in your trading application.",1614928437.0

13408,GME - POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF,lxwhpy,"As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. 

**TL;DR** the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.

**Here is what I did:** Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. 

**What is a gamma squeeze:** For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.

**Now that GME is @ $130:** Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. 

# GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)

**GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):** At this level going into Friday we could expect **22,427** in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About **2,242,700** to be exact or about **4.97%** of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. 

**GME @ $130:** We can expect **35,989** contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid **13,562** more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to **3,598,900** shares or **7.97%** of total float. Now we're getting nutty.

**What about GME @ $150:** Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be **46,397** contracts ITM. This means that a whopping **4,639,700** shares or **10.27%** of total float. **MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100**

**What does this mean?** Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, **10%** of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. 

Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. 

**Summary:** Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has **DOUBLED** I repeat **DOUBLED.** If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised **10%** of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still **50%** more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. 

&#x200B;

Ill say it again for those in the back ***DOUBLED*****.**

13414,Ryan Cohen’s Tweet - Ape Decipher,lxwe4n,"TL;DR - Potential hostile takeover unfolding.
 💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀

I know there are many theories bouncing around on the meaning of Ryan Cohen’s tweet earlier today. 

Here’s a take:

RC Ventures currently holds a 12.9% stake in GME with clearance to purchase up to a 19.9% stake (see form 8-K for standstill provision timelines). He tweeted a still from Pets.com at 2:19pm EST, shortly after the tweet GME went fucking vertical. Right before the still the puppet said “pUrElY iN aN AdViSoRy RoLe” prompting a puke emoji out of Ryan.

Sure it could have been a whale going long, delta hedging, etc.. but.... what if RC started acquiring a larger stake in GME in the midst of a hostile takeover?!

RC tried urging the board to review its current leadership privately for some time to no avail. He then decided to take his message public.. not long after this GameStop’s CFO Jim Bell “left on good terms” while Chewy’s former CFO sat on GameStop’s board. “Good terms” my ape ass!

RC Venture’s statement after 13D/A filing 

The Reporting Persons have engaged, and intend to continue to engage, in discussions with the Issuer’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the Board and other corporate governance enhancements. While the Reporting Persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the Issuer, the Reporting Persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.

GameStop’s board was increased from 10 to 13 with Ryan and co. joining with plans to have a vote to reduce the board back to 9 seats.


Start connecting the dots and I believe Ryan Cohen is taking the reigns.

13418,Thoughts on VSTO?,lxwd2w,"I know I know everyone is only into GME and AMC news so I'll gladly chew the downvotes here if I'm able to have a conversation with my fellow apes in the sporting goods market.

Lastest earnings showed they were up 35% last year, slaughtered the expected numbers. They control the majority of the ammo market in the middle of an ammo shortage, they acquired multiple failing ammo producers right in the middle of this as well. 

I think they are significantly undervalued and here's why; In this ammo shortage, when they're already earning quite well they announced that 04/01/21 the price of their ammo will increase 3-15%. They're currently scaling up production to meet demand to tackle the mountain of about 1 billion dollars in backlog. Did I mention that the ammo hoarders are THE least rational consumers on the planet? If a senator so much as suggests gun control or expanding background checks they go out and clean off store shelves. With the all blue admin we have now I think those folks are going to be as retarded as ever.

Today being the Red Wedding day for everything in the market, (except for the champs in GME), VSTO dropped to $28. Now this significant because ZERO bad news came out of the company, in fact sales appear to be up higher lately too.

I reaaaaally like this stock and bought up a bunch more shares today on the dip with 18.46 @$30.27 average. For those following the sporting goods industry what do y'all think, is there something here?

Either way! I was doing so fat sleuthing and ran across the stock - $ET, it reminds me of that little alien and while you all are posting rockets ships I want to be posting UFOs 🚀👉🛸🛸🛸🛸

This thing has a rating of strong buy across most large rating systems, currently sits at around 8 bucks a pop but has an outlook of 18! Obviously this thing isn't going to make you millions overnight (Unless you're putting in millions) but it will at least be a decent cash cow... Ahhh, Cows get abducted by UFOs I see what I did there.

But here are some stats for you apes

* Projected outlook 18.00 compared to its current 8.04 at time of writing
* Pays quarterly dividends of 0.15 per share at a 7.98% yield rate
* 5 star rated across multiple platforms
* Strong buy from multiple platforms
* Currently acquiring $ENBL to increase their foothold in pipelines and lower debt

* Currently Gather, Transport and Export their own Natural Gases
* Is set to be biggest powerhouse for Mid Southern US

So take that as you will but I seriously think tendie man is going to be paying me a visit this season.

13429,Are GME Spikes Helping Shorts?,lxw3dl,"I have a question - hoping for someone much smarter to explain.

&#x200B;

Won't these small spikes as we've seen week of Feb-26 and just Today Week of Mar-5 Help Shorts and couldn't they be engineered by shorts as well ?

The Thing that really helps with running up the option chain is if there are enough options bought and you force delta hedging especially with a stock like GME. If the price is very stable for a period of time (like after the Jan. Squeeze) for a few weeks, then the price of those options drop and a lot of people were able to buy them.

For example, the $115C was something like $1.50 per contract prior to the run-up we had week of Feb-26 and a lot of people were able to profit massively and I'm assuming many used the profits to buy more shares. Good Ape Move.

However, after that spike all the contracts going forward became much more expensive as the premiums and volatility went through the roof. This week, I was able to nag $200C for $1.6 and sold some for $8 which was a blessing but it seems to me, a spike or so every week keeps options prices high and thus prevents retailers from being able to afford call options which seems like a bit of a win for Short Sellers.

Is this logic sound at all? I'm dumb so any advice is helpful. But I had been waiting all week for premiums to drop on call options so I could afford a few that wasn't So out of the money.

If the pattern continues, then leading up to week of Mar-19 and Earnings Mar-26, premiums would get bumped up week after week. Maybe having the price itself stable at incremental steps up week to week far outweighs the options side of things. Thoughts?

Now back to today's UOA activity, where some ape bought 1300 Calls for 16 Million Dollar approx. now people might say it could be spread, sure may be but I don't see it here.

[UOA - 4 March](https://preview.redd.it/r6imk0lvr2l61.jpg?width=1987&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16429d6cd5de4df03044b75f13eb82c2e28e5cc4)

Yes I do have Stock position & Options positions myself. Here for April I will roll my own calls to April at right price.

I'm going to make this short because nobody's really interested in hearing the long winded circle jerk explanation about how bureaucratic government borrowing works. We've got milkshakes to put in the yard and your wife's boyfriend ain't gonna fuck himself.

I'm not a financial adviser and I only half-understand my own post.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ae9i9oijg2l61.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9273bcd806d3d3a3d8894332b8b76bc30ea55d0

So, the stock market is at all-time high and interest rates are at an all-time low. Meanwhile, there's half a pandemic going on in the country because at least 14 states are planning to reopen. At the same time Congress wants to borrow a bloated $1.9 Trillion budget to splurge on hookers and blow.

Happy times are here again...

Unfortunately, the fundamentals of companies are starting to solidify and they don't need the easy money with the economy reopening. The economy has a government spending hangover and wants interest prices to increase before hyperinflation appears.

However, Government promised a whole lotta freebies during the election and now people have turned up with pockets turned out waiting for their share.

The Fed decides it's not going to raise interest rates but fundamentals don't give a damn. Buyers don't want to buy worthless bonds and the government ""prints"" money by issuing bonds.

A classic catch-22...

Congress can't borrow $1.9 Trillion unless the Treasury issues more bonds. Investors won't buy the bonds unless the interest rate increases. If interest rates increase it becomes more expensive for everybody to borrow.

Basically...

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0n9cfhbeg2l61.gif

The yield bonds are increasing on their own because of all the inflation stuffed into the market over the past year. All the hedge funds who shorted GME and AMC are now in trouble. All their borrowed shares just got more expensive to hold and there's nothing they can do about it.

My hunch is today's sell off is a desperate money grab to try to keep the GME price down to keep their interest down. (At the time of writing this GME is rising)

Before they were slowly bleeding out money. Now they've nicked an artery it's gushing out.

TL;DR Raising bond yields means hedge funds have to pay more in interest to borrow stocks and they're doing a fire sale to cover their bets.

edit: I can't spell.

edit 2: The treasury issues bonds, not the fed. I was confused because Janet Yellen is everywhere. First at the fed, then in Citadel's pocket, now at the treasury. My bad.

edit 3: Thanks for all the awards. I spent all my internet tokens on milkshakes, hookers, and blow so the government wouldn't have to subsidize them.",1614916401.0

**$RKT NOT SQUOZE YET AT ALL***

There's just some facts I want to point out and please correct me if I'm wrong: don’t downvote if ur just a hater, downvote if my research doesn’t add up

Since the beginning of space exploration, the concept of going to the moon (or beyond) has never been done without a rocket. I don't need to put the ticker ($RKT) because there's some weird (non-existent) war being waged between game stoppers and rocket launchers.  FOR NO REASON!


1) $RKT got crushed yesterday, meaning there is an SSR in effect (I went to the Nasdaq site and didn't see it so please clarify). If there isn't - who cares.

1a) see 5)

2)  The fact of the matter is that [30 million shares were sold short yesterday](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210303.txt). Meaning it was shorted all the way down. By who? By us? By hedges? Who cares. 

2a) as of right now (5pm March 4th ) [RKT has second highest short %](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=131&amp;f=cap_smallover,geo_usa,sh_avgvol_o500,sh_curvol_o500,sh_opt_optionshort,sh_price_o3,sh_relvol_o1,sh_short_high&amp;o=-shortinterestshare) 


3) The market today is a disaster in its entirety due to the US Treasury and shaky paper hands everywhere. They say it's meme stocks but only difference these losers just print money, and make the rules. **We are the real traders**

4) There was a big 2.2 million buy right at open that sent the stock flying, my trading sen-sei verified this, according to lvl 2 data and I'm thinking this was institutional - it wasn't RIGHT at open. You can literally see it at Mkt open. 

5) The spaceship hasn't really gone down significantly. It didn't crash and burn like SpaceX's. This is on a very bad day in the market overall and lots of tension. It went down to 25-ish briefly and shot back up. Our rocket has not crashed and burned and held up quite well after a 70+% increase. If there was no SSR today, then wtf it’s definitely bottomed. 

6 (and the most important - toronto man): The dividend pays out $1.11 per share to every holder of the stock on March 9th. If a 2.2 million share buy sent the share put the price up, imagine when retail (and more institutions) buy in ahead of March 9th. Share buyback too?

Rebounded strong in the second half of the day with a huge surge and once again finished above this projected baseline at $128.50.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: This theory is also correlative with/supported by the fact GME fought hard to stay green yesterday (March 3rd) when the entire market was bleeding. It will be interesting to see how it responds when we approach the close today since we've spent the early morning under this baseline as part of a complete market selloff.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me begin by saying, this could be an absolute coincidence, but my tinfoil hat and Alex Jones voodoo doll suggested otherwise. So, I took Eddie Bravo’s advice, and I “LOOKED INTO IT.” These are my findings.

This is NOT financial advice; nor should it be construed as such. I am a broke law student with a vested interest in the success of GME. I also have an innate ability to decipher logic and rational behavior, so I’ve decided to share my opinion with you all for your own preponderance. Feel free to discuss, as I embrace the importance of evaluating a set of facts from various perspectives.

If you have not done so already, please read, or skim, the OP below, and pay homage to both [u/dan\_bren](https://new.reddit.com/u/dan_bren/) and [u/tapakip](https://new.reddit.com/u/tapakip/) for their service in bringing this information to my attention. Once you’ve done so, return here. If you’ve read their posts already, proceed to the gates of Valhalla below.

[$100MM of DEEP ITM GME CALLS have been purchased since 3/1(Monday) : GME (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx5kgk/100mm_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have_been_purchased/)

&#x200B;

Don't be a dick. Just skim it at least. Or my analysis won't make sense at first.

&#x200B;

As [u/tapakip](https://new.reddit.com/u/tapakip/) points out in the comment below, there is a very strong presumption that these calls were all purchased by the same buyer. They are the only one purchasing calls that are this deep ITM within the last three days, and are all purchased out of the Philadelphia exchange. It's actually mindboggling to me that anyone would be willing to shell out this much premium and take on the exponential amounts of risk. All in all, it makes the most logical sense that these have all been bought by the same individual when considering the facts we have.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx5kgk/100mm\_of\_deep\_itm\_gme\_calls\_have\_been\_purchased/gpl5wso?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx5kgk/100mm_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have_been_purchased/gpl5wso?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

Now, as you know (I hope), each call option is the right to purchase 100x of the underlying. In the calculations below, I assume you know can comprehend the following equation:

>Options x Strike = Exercise cost (x100)

Before you say some dumb shit in the comments, \*\*Do not confuse exercise cost with the purchase price of the actual option.\*\* We'll get there. Thanks in advance, dumbass.

**3/1/2021 Purchases**

* 540 x 12 = $648,000
* 540 x 12 = $648,000
* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000
* 600 x 12 = $720,000
* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000
* \*515 x 7 = $360,500
* \*500 x 5 = $250,000

**3/2/2021 Purchases**

* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000
* 600 x 15 = $900,000

**3/3/2021 Purchases**

* 1,300 x 12 = $1,560,000
* 600 x 15 = $900,000
* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000
* 580 x 12 = $696,000
* 580 x 12 = $696,000
* 550 x 12 = $696,000

What do all of these add up to?

I’ll save you idiots the trouble. **It costs an additional $12,298,500 in order for this whale to exercise all of their calls.**

Next, let’s find out what this leviathan actually spent to acquire these options. Yes, asshole, now I am calculating the purchase price. Sorry for your inconvenience.

New equation:

>Options x Price = Cost Basis (x100)

**3/1/2021 Purchases**

* 540 @ 98.45 = 5,316,300
* 540 @ 96.05 = 5,186,700
* 1200 @ 105.85 = 12,702,000
* 600 @ 101.25 = 6,075,000
* 600 @ 99.60 = 5,976,000
* \*515 @ 106.55 = 5,487,325
* \*500 @ 110.90 = 5,545,000

**3/2/2021 Purchases**

* 1200 @ 108.15 = 12,978,000
* 600 @ 104.95 = 6,297,000

**3/3/2021 Purchases**

* 1,300 @ 108.40 = 14,092,000
* 600 @ 105.15 = 6,309,000
* 600 @ 103.15 = 6,189,000
* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700
* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700
* 550 @ 109.00 = 5,995,000

I won’t even ask this time, I know you can’t count that high. **It’s a grand total of $104,582,725.** OP’s estimate of $100MM was very close. To be blunt, that’s a lot of cocaine and hookers.

# 

# This is where things get interesting.

&#x200B;

Now, as OP also pointed out, **the buyer has the right to purchase 942,500 shares by April 16** (note: the options above with an \* expire on Jan 20, 2023 and Jan 21, 2022, respectively). Nevertheless, they are all ITM, so the buyer can exercise them whenever they feel enlightened.

Let’s do some more math; apes love math. This behemoth has already shelled out \~$104MM for these options and has the RIGHT, not obligation, to shell out an additional $12,298,500 for the actual shares.

$104,582,725 + $12,298,500 = **$116,881,225 (purchase price + exercise price)**

We also know the total # of shares to be \[potentially\] exercised is 942,500.

Using this information, we’ve (me, mostly) done enough work to extrapolate a rough break-even price for this colossus of clout buyer.

**$116,881,225 / 942,500 = 124.01**

# This big whale’s total breakeven price lands at $124.01/share.

&#x200B;

Shut the hell up. I know you just mumbled to yourself ""that’s underwhelming as fuck."" Just consider yourself a smooth brain. That's why I'm here.

I will admit, that on its face, it might seem like I wasted all of our time. Now hit that joint or Moscow mule and ponder what it actually means……

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Welcome back brother. If you couldn’t think of anything, again confirming how smooth your brain is, let me help.

&#x200B;

A *massive fucking buyer* just exposed themselves to an exorbitant amount of risk; they could LOSE *tens of millions* within minutes. With that in mind, I can guaran-fuckin-tee that nobody on this planet would over-leverage themselves in the amount of \~$116,881,225 without having (A) some extremely important information or (B) some serious fucking diamond kahonas. My wager would be on the former, but also the latter.

**In any case, anyone who drops \~$116M over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets. They have more money, that’s a fucking fact.**

Compound that with this buyer’s breakeven at $124.01. **It logically follows, we have found our new BASELINE PRICE for GME.** Let me explain.

Consider all this information with what happened yesterday. **GME CLOSED AT $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER’s BREAKEVEN.**

What ensued in AH? A back-and-forth teetertotter throughout the entire AH session. Ultimately, every time GME dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.

In sum, I believe the new baseline price is $124.01. Relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning, I am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending his/her breakeven price at $124.01. Do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else. They might, but its in their own best interest to hold that line, whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern. Furthermore, think about it yourself, if you dropped a combined $100M in three consecutive days, you must have a contingency plan. It is my belief that this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options. They'll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play.

I would be remissed if I didn't acknowledge there's a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass Ape like us hitting a ballsdeep YOLO play with his entire Trustfund inheritance. But I doubt it.

In the event my hypothesis checks out, GME is currently sitting at its new support level. This is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity.

# TL;DR.

**I believe the new baseline price for GME is $124.01.** This is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent \~$104M (\~$116M if exercised) on call options spanning the last three days, March 1st-March 3rd.

With that in mind **GME closed yesterday at $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER’s BREAKEVEN.**

To go further, **every time GME dropped below $124 in the AH session, it hit a springboard** back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.

It is my belief that **this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets** than what they leveraged out on the options. They'll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play, **which means keeping the price above their $124.01 breakeven.**

13685,Not clear if I still trust in an honest market for average Joe to invest.,lxq4do,"  

I'm looking for somewhere to blow some steam. I've been navigating how to invest my hard working savings for over two decades, and because of pandemic, as many other people, I saw myself with my savings going down the drain. So, I tried to educate me in how to operate a trading account, and since then I learn how to take my winning and losses gracefully. (mostly losses) Learn how to look charts and try to find the best moment to get into a position I believe is in a good place for swing or long term investment, and not day trade. However, as we all know, market is bearish, and everything goes with it. But looking into the recent events with GameStop, I got myself wondering. Did the big money guys, that have been clearly manipulating the market forever, leaving the average Joe (like myself) to either give them my money (so they can correctly ""manage"" it for me) or they will take it by creating movements that swap your stop loses positions or zero or cash. 

The reason I'm saying that is because just yesterday, some big money guy releases some intel on a company call XL Fleet, saying he is going short on it because he got some insider giving him intel, which leads him to believe the company is not worth the money. Therefore, creating and extreme down movement, which he capitalize on it, because a lot of people just react to information and don't educate themselves before selling or buying, and hurting people that have a honest plan to invest in an apparent good business model. I understand the risks in investing in a fairly new company, but there is no limit to what these guys can put out there? They can say any crap, and then capitalize in people's overreaction? The GameStop saga did not teach anyone anything? 

Really disappointing. Not just losing a substantial amount of money, that eventually will correct, but the unnecessary volatility that these ""professionals"" take profits in people's money.

13686,United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) - Bull Thesis From a Real Estate Professional,lxq24n,"I've been building a position in United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices I decided to offer some DD to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio.

**TLDR: UWMC is better than RKT and I think it's better for both the short-term traders and the long-hold investors.**

I have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over Reddit recently so I won't bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows:

* Went public with a $16B valuation based on ONLY three quarters of 2020 (9.5X multiple on adjusted income)
* In Q3 2020 alone they did $1.45B in net income (which means their Q4 reporting towards the end of April is going to be massive!)
* At today's price the dividend yield is over 4% annually!  Ex-dividend date is this coming Tuesday, meaning if you're going to buy do it BEFORE Tuesday March 9th
* It was announced this week they'll be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 Index beginning March 22nd which means EXTRA buying necessity between now and earnings

**For the semi-retarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP!**

&#x200B;

Now, as a realtor I'd like to add some professional analysis here and I'll touch on RKT briefly too because they're being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different.

&#x200B;

1. It doesn't matter what mortgage rates are, mortgage originators always make X% margin on every loan they sell. **What matters is the number of purchases and refi's (ie how many widgets they sell)** Nationwide there is a MASSIVE shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to ""normal"" we'll see 1X, 2X, 5x, and in some markets even 10X the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated.  **Profits are way higher on new purchases vs. refi's so while nobody is turning refi's down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases.**  Anybody who tuned in to UWMC's final sales call of 2020 for their national reps heard their **CEO Matt Ishba talking about how they'd spend the money they'd get from going public and he was all about RELATIONSHIPS**.  Relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence (insurance agents, title companies, etc)
2. **RKT has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan** than what is considered normal (3-4 weeks right now). Originators like the salespeople working through UWMC have a major competitive advantage against Rocket and others because they close deals fast! That is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option.  **RKT may get a lot of market share for refi's (the lower profitability loans) but UWMC is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume**, especially as supply of homes for sale (new and pre-owned) increases to meet demand).

Now, anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now!  Think ""*Melvin Capital scrounging for GME shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever*"" insane!  Mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are FOMO'ing hardcore into paying these escalating prices.  ***That's a great thing for sellers but doesn't do anything good or bad for UWMC holders.***

&#x200B;

**THIS IS WHAT MATTERS FOR UWMC INVESTORS:**

**As inventory increases** (*which it will because in some states Covid made it near impossible to sell*) in 2021 **and as prices become to normalize** (*causing more people to want to move because it won't be insanely expensive on the buy side*) **the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase**.  Again, it doesn't matter if interest rates go up a little, it's not like they're going to double.  Interest rates are at all time lows [as seen here from Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) and that isn't going to change for years to come.

UWMC pays a regular dividend, is about to announce an insane Q4 on or around April 23rd, and since they're the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into 2021.

**Short-Term Traders:** Best bet for you is to buy slightly OTM April or May calls.  Personally I'd buy May calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings run-up (if that happens) and/or holding them through ER if the run-up isn't significant enough due to the market's overall vibe right now.  Buying May calls gives you extra insurance which I like but degens should stick to April and save the premim.

**Long Term Investors:** At current prices (between $9-10/share today) if you're not buying now than there is no helping you.  I've bought at levels as low as $9 and as high as $12 and I'm comfortable anywhere in that range.  I don't think a price of $16-18 by year's end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with.  I believe we'll see over $20/share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to 2019 levels and I'd guesstimate that is 50/50 shot.

**TLDR Again: Tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP in April!**

**My Buy Orders Today Are Set:**

* 1,000 shares @ $8.51
* 1,000 shares @ $8.41
* 1,000 shares @ $8.31

&#x200B;

**Again, this is just the bull thesis.**  I think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that I can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested.  Well....

1. Making money is sexy to me, I don't know about you fruits
2. Most of the members here are young and untested too, probably spreading STI's all over your local areas via Grinder before Covid

**Good luck to all, happy trading, and let's expand our horizons a little like the old days of WSB.**

**Edit 1:** u/ElSanDavid was kind enough to point out below that a director recently bought 60,000 shares on March 1st and the average analyst rating is $12.50.

Edit 2: Adding this [amazing article](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2021/03/04/united-wholesale-mortgage-ultimatum-rocket-companies/4578357001/) where the CEO of UWM, Matt Ishbia, walked into the room for his Facebook Live broadcast to UWM's brokers, unzipped his pants, whipped his thing out, smacked them around a little bit, and zipped back up and dropped the mic.  **TLDR: He told UWM loan officers that effective Mid-March they must decide whether they'll keep working with Rocket OR United Wholesale Mortgage because working with both would no longer be an option (this will hurt RKT, not UWMC).**",1614907726.0

I’ve been watching different companies on here to see the market sentiment/ in which way the institutional buyers are betting the stock will go in.. I dont really understand what most of this means since I only started eating crayons a month ago but according to retards its a good thing there is so many puts.. OR IS THERE??!?!?!?!!

These numbers barely changed from March 3rd before closing to March 5 pre market, only increased—-> meaning driving the price of gme down because long term option contracts betting against gme, but gme is doing good now and LOOKS even better later so wtf?

**What the fuck? Where are all the hundreds of thousands of put options???**

My guess is that Hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down  during lunch hours, when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40% gains everyday due to SI...

These orders all stayed in, the first 10 even 20 minutes of market open..I thought they probably won’t change since I just started to actually use bren, but then I look and its way different...

Some of y’all are gonna hate but Ive been watching RKT alongside since this week.. Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?

Edit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??

 Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  “ dividend news”  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..

So they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby

Mind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1/3 of their float because there wasn’t a high demand, the news “oddly didnt cover or care about their debut” which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover?? Especially with such low amount of shares avail to short and such an insanely massive borrow rate???

EDIT: GME NEW UPDATE, THE MASSIVE PUT OPTIONS ARE BACK!

I started looking at the RKT short interest and its insanely high??? I dont have the tools or smooth brain to actually know what 97% of this means but for some reason it tickles my pickle

Is it normal for a stock to have 57% short interest borrow fee rate?? And only 75k shares to be available on a stock that has 100m shares outstanding???

This is the short interest on GME, compare it to RKT,

TL;DR KEEP HODLING GME, ONLY BUY IF U CAN AT DIPS, ROCKET IS READY, REFUELING!

GME IS STILL GONNA ROCKET TO THE MOON BUT RKT COULD BE EZ MONEY GAINS OR QUITE HEAVY LOSS PORN  
( a lot of ppl already profited off it including myself, very high SI%, CEO hates shooters, low shares avail to borrow and borrow rate is 44% last I checked March 4th 2pm... I dont think its the end, I think more profits are possible because everyone keeps saying DONT BUY RKT and when ppl say dont buy It makes me want to buy because im retarded haha)

There is a lot of things I cant find because of my limited resources, or because im not smooth brained enough to understand. If anyone finds this useful ill be happy, I could be 100% wrong here, thats actually my specialty. I hope some

After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it’s down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price & News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that’s why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that’s amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It’s current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That’s a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can’t afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent “NEWS” on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China’s fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah… that’s a serious reprimand… This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people’s republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what’s going on here? China is publicly reprimanding a company that it is actively working with to bring in the future. [MYbank, backed by Alibaba's Ant Group, joins China's digital yuan pilot (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/mybank-backed-by-alibabas-ant-group-joins-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.html)

Ignore the noise, ignore the “Smart Money” they have a time horizon of 2 weeks. We have the time horizon of DIAMONDS!!

My position is 6 BABA 280p sold short at $61 I also have 5 credit spreads 290/300p

TL:DR BABA could double based on its current valuation and the fact that it continues to grow, is picked by government to work on digital currency roll out and its low P/e",1614903528.0

13750,The reason for the ridiculous put/call interest in GME,lxnh3p,"Imma keep this short(no pun intended) but sweet. Keep in mind I'm an idiot and this is only speculative. 

For every option bought or sold, someone makes the other side of that trade. Whatever market ""maker"" takes on the risk for someone else opening a position in options contracts  needs to delta hedge their books to keep themselves neutral in the name. If your mind hasn't contorted into a pretzel yet, stay with me. 

&#x200B;

Hedge fund-A buys 100 contracts of Mar19 $2 Puts at .04. Hedge fund or market maker B(from here on I'll just call them MM-B) is now stuck with 100 short puts which they are responsible for. MM-B cannot allow the potential risk in those contracts to incur losses(\*should GME hit that strike by expiry), as such they go out into the open market and short shares equivalent to the negative delta value of the options contract in this case a fraction of a cent but for simplicity's sake lets call that .01. 

&#x200B;

HF-A has spent $400 to create 100 shares of artificial selling in GME. They aren't shorting the stock anymore, they're forcing MM-B to delta hedge and suppress price in the process. 

&#x200B;

The inverse is also true. For instance on Jan 29th the fabled $800 strike options were written, likely naked short by those with short positions in the name (HF-A) right before trading restrictions were put in place. Curious. MM-B now is long farrrr OTM Calls and need to delta hedge that position by, yet again, shorting shares equal to the delta value in the open market. 

&#x200B;

This portion I'm likely wrong about, but from what I can see, about $40 million went into an ITM call sweep yesterday which in turn drove price up for a time. I believe this was in direct response to bears forcing other market entities to take opposing positions. It was someone saying to HF-A ""enough, stop making us do more work than we have to""

&#x200B;

You might be wondering about now, why does this matter? is this a bull or bear argument being made here? 

It's neither. The Oi of any given strike means fuck-all at the end of the day because the majority of contracts are going to $0 regardless. I'm just trying to frame some of the heavy put and call buying we've seen in what I believe to be the most candid way I can. 

&#x200B;

It's more likely these are being bought and sold to suppress price into a range in which the market makers selling premium will collect on all the contracts you apes have bought for Mar 19th 2021. :)

&#x200B;

The problem with this is that it's turned GME into a powder keg.. SHOULD the impossible happen and price breaks free into either direction, volatility is going to be insane. You have gamma squeezes set up in both directions, which makes me believe price is all the more likely to be defended in the $80-$130 range through Mar 19. 

&#x200B;

Anyway that's just my take. Don't listen to me. I am not financial advice. thx

&#x200B;

TLDR; The open interest in any give contract doesn't really mean shit at the end of the day. You guys sounds like complete fucking idiots discussing Oi like it's the holy grail. Quad witching always has a shitload of Oi.",1614901609.0

13788,$PUBM - Secular Tailwinds & High % Short,lxmf50,"Let me tell you all about a little company called Pubmatic $PUBM.

**TLDR;**

\- Secular Tailwinds in Programmatic Advertising Space & Connected TV - Very Good- Solid Financials - Very Good- Valuation - UNDERVALUED LIKE CRAZY- Short Interest - Someone look it up, but it's anywhere from 30-80%**- Good Industry + Solid Financials + Undervalued + High Short Interest = VERY GOOD**

**INTRODUCTION**

Pubmatic is in the programmatic advertising space and is a supply-side platform (SSP) where it works with publishers to maximize their advertising revenue and if you don't know much about that space, let me tell you about three other companies that have benefited tremendously from the secular tailwinds in this space: The Trade Desk ($TTD), Magnite ($MGNI), Acuity Ads ($ACUIF)

The Trade Desk, Magnite, Acuity Ads have all benefited tremendously from the big shift to programmatic advertising (bunch of ads that show up on various websites based on your interests) and most of all: Connected Television (CTV) where legacy cable advertisers are shifting their ad dollars to move into digital advertising within televisions (i.e. Hulu, Roku, IMDB, etc.).

There are **BIG dollars moving from legacy TV to digital TV and traditional advertising to programmatic advertising.**

Just look at their stock prices in the past 1 year/3-years:

TTD: 150% / 1,122%MGNI: 317% / 2502%ACUIF: 1390% / 1454%

Anyway going back to Pubmatic. This little company IPO'd in December 2020 and basically for most of December didn't have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of December.

Then come January and February Pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing Pubmatic's potential in this space, but the real reckoning came when they announced earnings on February 23 where they not only beat earnings, THEY **CRUSHED earnings** and they did one even better, they gave **SOLID guidance for Q1** and FY 2021 despite having little visibility into the back half of 2021.

**FINANCIALS**

&#x200B;

|Revenue (In $ Ms)||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|
|2018|||||$99.3|
|2019|$23.6|$27.4|$28.5|$34.4|$113.9|
|2020|$28.3|$26.4|$37.8|$56.2|$148.7|
|2021|$38-40|||||

&#x200B;

|Revenue % YoY|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 vs. 2019|19.9%|\-3.7%|32.6%|**63.4%**|
|2021 vs. 2020|**41.3%**||||

Look at that Revenue **ACCELERATION** from 19.9% to 63.4% by Q4 and guiding for 41.3% which they will easily beat by at least a few points if not more (most companies guide with some padding).

**They are also GAAP PROFITABLE**. Most tech companies are Non-GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation which cuts into earnings, but this little company is PROFITABLE already.

Their Net Income Margin for Q4 was 33.5% which is incredible and for the year they finished with a 17.9% Net Income Margin despite COVID beating the crap out of this business in Q2.

This is a company that is executing brilliantly and has done so profitability as well. They also have really happy employees and a bunch of reviews too: [https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm)

**VALUATION**

When it comes to tech companies, given their lack of GAAP profitability, they are often valued on an Enterprise Value to Sales ratio (EV/S).

&#x200B;

|Company Name|TTM EV/S|Q4 Growth Rate|Q1 Guidance|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The Trade Desk|44.8|\+48%|\+35%|$37.8 B|
|Magnite|26.1|20% (Pro Forma)|\+20-40% (Pro-forma)|$5.9 B|
|Pubmatic|**18**|\+63.4%|\+41.3%|$2.6 B|

Pubmatic is growing significantly faster than The Trade Desk and Magnite and has a multiple that is at least 30%+ less. This makes no sense! How is a company growing faster than its peers that offers a product that has a ton of traction, and executing brilliantly valued so much less? If they were to get an equal multiple, this stock would be trading in the $90+ range at least.

**SHORT INTEREST & VOLUME**

Now it gets interesting. I have no idea if the sources I'm reviewing are correct, but this is what I'm seeing:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)

It shows % Short Float at **32.2%** which seems like a lot to me.

Another article per TheStreet.com shows short float % at: **80.3%!!!!**

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm\_ven=YAHOO](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO)

I have no idea which source is correct, all I know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results. Perhaps it's due to it being a new IPO or something, but the stock skyrocketed to $76 before cratering down to $52 due to the recent market volatility and I wouldn't doubt that the high % short float, whatever it is, is causing that to some degree.

Regardless, it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze. If $RKT could double with a short float % of 38% or so and it being a $30 B company prior to the squeeze, I would anticipate a company that is < $3 B in market cap and doesn't have a ton of trading volume everyday, could see some potential uptick.

**Wrapping Up**

I think Pubmatic is a great company. They seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with HUGE secular tailwinds. I anticipate this company will do very well by its own, but given how much short interest there is, this could be an interesting play too.

I’ve been a heavy lurker of WSB since the GME rise and this community has vibe. I’m not an OG but have noted when og’s post on what it used to be and I was here pre 2million and I’ve watched closely (I live on refreshing new) how this sub has evolved over the last 2 months. 

UWMC started popping up so I checked it out and saw that a bottom could be nearing so I put in a tiny bit just to watch it (10@9.80). I then went back to dig for some real DD. Problem is, there is none. This has a P&amp;amp;amp;D feel and an ugly stench. I was bummed when RKT took off (without me on it and there was good DD on it) but the plummet got me hopeful that maybe some of the gains gets funneled into GME (I have a position). Which leads me back to UWMC.  It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t look right. It doesn’t seem right. 

If UWMC is a hedge distraction, involving yourself only helps them. If you’ve done your own DD and believe, awesome. I for one won’t be tossing anything more at it. Good luck out there.

My original post was taken down and I’m not sure why. I’m not hip to all the rules. If the opening is any indication, I think it bolsters my theory. And to the folks that think I’m GME focused. I am but wouldn’t be sad if it drops to the 80s, that’s called a fire sell and I love buying shit on sale.

Edit: The main point of this post wasn’t to be a conspiracy but to be weary of the hype. Do your own DD. If you like the stock then buy it. The whole you better get on board now crowd is sketch and was why I posted this in the first place. Make your money. Do what you like, I don’t care either way. I wish everybody all the tendies.

Edit 2: Check out user whiteytighties comment thread. Sound thoughts on why it’s a good investment and also giving a bit of credence to my thoughts.

Edit 3: whiteytighties thread got deleted but he got a crazy amount of upvotes in a small time frame and I got downvoted into oblivion. He said I may be onto something. His words were “that’s fishy”. I’d also like to say my point wasn’t about the company itself but the talk and current action around it.",1614897891.0

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are *highly moderated* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

13820,Why $UWMC is still most definitely the play,lxlj79,"Alright y’all, yesterday a lot of you apes bought in as the price zoomed up premarket and are now bagholding and freaking out. Don’t fret my fellow degenerates. If you woke up and looked at the price premarket today you probably got spooked, but it has been a brutal 24 hours for the market. Good thing $UWMC is a long term hold! Yes there will be volatility this week and next as traders look for day trade and swing trade moves. But, I cannot wait for 3/19. 

I’d argue yesterday was a pretty damn good day for $UWMC regardless of entry price. I personally would have used those dips to average down and accumulate some shares, but what do I know I’m just a smooth brained bag holder. Anyway, UWMC still ended up green 5%. (Shoutout GME for finishing green as well!) Do I need to remind you guys what happened to $RKT yesterday? A lot of those investors jumped ship and hopped on $UWMC! But at the same time, $RKTs demise certainly scared some potential $UWMC investors away, kinda oxymoronic. UWMC has its own momentum, and will get to orbit regardless of what $RKT does due to all of the catalysts and intangibles I mentioned in my first [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwfasi/why_uwmc_is_most_definitely_the_play/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

(TLDR: Dividend date 3/10 and Russell 1000 &amp;amp;amp;amp; 3000 index addition 3/22). 

The shorts were ALL over UWMC yesterday. It went from 1,000,000 available shares shorted on 3/2, to under 90,000 shares available to short by market close yesterday. (Editing for transparency: looks like some shorts have closed their positions and it’s up to 250,000 short shares available as of 9:15 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc ) Of course the institutions are gonna jump all over this once they see WSB talking about it because they know there are a lot of paper hands who will get scared and sell, but diamond hands are needed to beat these losers 💎 🙌.

While a short squeeze is certainly possible, I think the true potential comes in the form of a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Look at all these calls for 3/19 https://imgur.com/a/99Cx5LI 

If $UWMC can stay above $10, this has the potential to go to Mars, and fly right past the moon! 

I would like to add that while all this options activity is fantastic, it will be all for nothing if the contracts aren’t backed up with shares. I’ll personally be loading up on shares while this thing is still reasonably priced.

Take care of yourselves

I've seen a lot of DDs repeating similar assumptions on gamma squeeze/delta hedging without actually providing accurate calculation on it; And it seemed, with the 7 million plus influx of new members to wsb, a large portion of  newcomers don't know the option's greeks yet. ***Thus, the reason for this post is to enable everyone here in wsb, to calculate the gamma squeeze effect for themselves(rough approximation), instead of relying on random DDs figures.***

The attached excel sheet allows you to model squeeze scenarios

[Based on 3\/3\/21 Market Close Data](https://preview.redd.it/rs16fz0ye0l61.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f0b249586e6852164f6099f0647ef41cb117615)

*^(You'll need to enable macro, needed to run Black Scholes functions, I promise no virii inside)*

So based on  the market close data of 3/3/21, using options data up to the 3/19 expiry, the net delta hedged shares by MMs stands at 6,852,559 \*(\*\*^(If we assume most MMs try to be delta neutral)\*). And if $GME price were  to increase to 200$, they would need to buy an additional 6,261,580 shares

Now suppose you want to see what happens when someone buy 20,000 of 3/12 200 calls. Go the EXPIRY2\_CALLS sheet and edit the Open Interest of the options

check back at the cover sheet, the net buy needed by MMs,

https://preview.redd.it/ole9xl74f0l61.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eafbc47275580cb868f25b9b8e7d848c2a786c8

is now 6,825,991 vs 6,261,580 previously, an increase of 564,411 shares. So a call option worth 20,000 x 5.2 x 100 = 10,400,000$, if the stock price increased from 124.8 to 200 (in 1 day) would have triggered an added 564,411 shares delta hedged (rough approximation), which was worth 564,411 x 124.8 = 70,438,492$ if bought outright, giving an amplification factor of roughly 7:1.(^(not using tick data to forecast price increase vs buying volume)) One common misconception is that if a call becomes ITM near expiry, MMs would have already bought >90% of it in delta hedge, however  for a high IV like $GME, its closer to 60%.

*EDIT 1 : Assuming of course that most of your counterparty is MM(not closing out trades) and not wsb theta gang or people selling covered puts, I'll put the figure for $GME around 70-90%,*

*EDIT 2 : I've added a simple pct value for people that pointed out, some counterparties would not be MMs, such as  spreads and covered calls/puts. For $GME I estimate the probability of 1 sigma(68%) of net MM would be around 50-80%, and 2 sigma(95%) would be 40-90%. The option data already includes multiple expires up until 3/19, which is the period with the heaviest OI.*

Wanted to post an update from Ortex this morning showing the following

1. Free Float Short Interest has not budged, in fact it increased since the run from the 21ish
2. Borrow fees have skyrocketed
3. Look at the similarities between GME and RKT...it appears today and tomorrow will be interesting days

Now I'm not saying that RKT is GME, but they have similar patterns in their charts/short interest and RKT has 2 pretty insane catalysts upcoming that shorts will have to deal with

1. Dividend of $1.11/sh they will have to pay if they don't cover by close on 3/5 (tomorrow)
2. $1B buyback that they could drop the hammer at any time

Positions : 6k shares and 25x $25 3/5 calls...will add on any dip

This entertainment, not financial advice. This is just a 🏳‍🌈🐻 look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to. TLDR first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand what's happening.

TL,DR: The fed is no longer in control of interest rates. Stocks are artificially inflated due to the Fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments, with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments. This used to not be an issue as the Fed was in control of how much QE could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers, but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity, the Fed will now have no choice but to start the process of QT, but to do that they need to sell bonds, which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates. To sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates, resulting in a sea of red and the🏳‍🌈🐻's taking a trip to tendietown.

Part 1: Macro 101 review:

If you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts, feel free to skip this part. This section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ.

For this DD we will need to understand the concepts of money supply, money velocity, open market operations, QE, and QT. Money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. Money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy. More info at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\_supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity\_of\_money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money)

Open market operations refers to the Fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market, which is one of three monetary tools the Fed has at its disposal, with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this DD. QE and QT refer to quantitative easing/tightening, which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy.

Part 2: What's been happening so far:

Now that we have let the retards off the short bus, lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here. I want to get to what is happening with the bonds and I will try to keep this as short as possible.

As we all know, the Fed has been printing money like crazy since last year, with JPow money machine go brrrr. As a result, the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit, which we can see below in the M2 graph:

&#x200B;

[M2 money supply](https://preview.redd.it/r3kdt4v2pyk61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=251465226f305cd7687d088ee853546ef116f3eb)

Unless you have been living under a rock this past year, the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic. If money velocity is down, people and businesses aren't spending, and if people and businesses aren't spending, the economy contracts. Hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat:

&#x200B;

[Velocity of M2 supply](https://preview.redd.it/yqs9c8c6pyk61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b140b90c74d9d2e229e6e72b2cb17631566537)

The primary way that the Fed has been dumping money into the economy is through Quantitative easing, meaning that the Fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations, AKA operation Bears R Fuk. This effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash, freeing up money in the economy.

While the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet, the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year. Why? Because for the most part, corporations, institutions, and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the Fed during open market operations, which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money. Corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates, US Government bond interest rates are garbage, businesses have been risky investments due to the 'rona, and only the stonks market has gone up. If we look at just before the pandemic to today, the value of all the stocks in the S&P500 have increased around 5 TRILLION dollars. The graph that shows this can be seen here [https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp\_500\_market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap).

Keep in mind that the GDP shrunk around 2.3% last year and unemployment is still relatively high, meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all.

Part 3: What looks to be happening:

Ok, that was long. Now onto the bonds.Lets think about what's been happening so far over the past few bear weeks. Bond yields go up, market takes a massive shit, calls on $ROPE increase in value, The Bearcave(TM) becomes the hot new club. Right now, yields have nowhere to go but up, and the fed has no choice but to increase them, thereby tanking the market, which we will see next.

As the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up, the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy, artificially inflating it. If we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity, we will have a serious problem on our hands. This is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased, so more money will represent the same pool of goods, causing an extreme amount of inflation. The money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2, electric boogaloo, but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases.

The fed knows this, and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102). This is quantitative tightening in action, with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy.

But there is a problem that the Fed is currently facing, which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates. To get people to buy their bonds, they have no choice but to raise interest rates. Time is also ticking, as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the FRED money velocity graph, meaning that if the fed doesn't raise rates, inflation will become a problem very quickly, and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire US economy will be extremely fucked. As a side note the ratio of increase is higher in M1 than M2, which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers. Unfortunately for the stock market, but fortunately for the **🏳‍🌈🐻**'s who have not been hunted to extinction, as bond yields increase, money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy, reducing the total funds in the stock market, causing it to crash.

Part 4: My (Dance) Moves:

Phew. That was long. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this post, it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time, and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities. To take advantage of this I plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS. Again this is not financial advice, and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first, you are actually retarded.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: (not financial advice)

Hi everybody. It looks like my post gained some traction last night. As a thank you to those who have read and commented, I will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all.

One of the more common questions/points is that the fed just won't allow rates to raise because they don't want it to.

Again like it says in the DD, at this time I do not believe the Fed is in control of the interest rates, and will quickly have no choice in the matter, no matter what daddy JPow says they will do. It may not happen today or this week, but it is coming. As money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening, inflation takes off like a bat out of hell. If inflation goes up, the US dollar becomes less valuable, and if it goes up too much, the US Gov't will have exciting new problems to deal with. To reduce the money supply through QT the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply, meaning that they need to sell bonds, which will require higher interest rates because they just aren't selling with the shit rates they are at now. The rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain.

Another question is that why hold cash if there is inflation? Won't I lose money?

That may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold, but you will have much less of it if you HODL during a crash or try to time the market.

OK, now that some questions have been answered, bonus round:

First lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out. The best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand. If we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market, we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value, as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market.

Another thing to realize is that the Fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it. No matter what they do, there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags. Loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad, as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds. Capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market, potentially sending shocks through the system. Do nothing and inflation fucks everything. Raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet. Rates are also so low they can't be decreased further.

Finally, no matter what happens in the market, UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS are currently at rock bottom prices. There is little room for them to shrink, but an enormous amount of room for them to grow.

Once again, thanks everybody and this is not financial advice.

JPow Interview and bond activity update: (as of 3/4/21, 4:00 PM)

&#x200B;

Ok, this will be the last update on this DD before I let it ride and see what happens. After watching the JPow Jobs Summit interview, there are three things to take away, with the first two relevant and the third being very important. First is that at (3:55), Powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening, the Fed will be expecting excess inflation. This is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases, we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation.

The second is that for now, until the fed sees its goals met, i.e. max employment and price stability, or until inflation becomes a problem, the Fed will continue its policy of QE (timestamps 9:55 & 18:55). This will continue to inject money into the economy, so no big surprise there, but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market, so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market, that may potentially have an effect on the current QE being undertaken.

The first two things are not surprising, but the third big takeaway is quite important, which is that the Fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates. At (13:50), Powell was asked about the market sentiment that the Fed will raise rates earlier than expected. His response was that the Fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive. As of now, inflation is around 1.5%, and the fed has a target of 2%. Powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory, but at (24:30) **Powell also said that the Fed will not let inflation get out of control,** and was very adamant about that.

The third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the US Gov't is struggling to unload bonds, it seems to suggest that the Fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity. The sentiment in the bond market seems to agree, with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1.564%. This is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve, and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market. If this continues I would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks, further crashing the stock market. See y'all at my new favorite club, The Bearcave(TM).

14010,Bet on the Fed - Consider calls on $IEF,lxcnle,"Markets are correcting harder than your 6th grade math teacher on the first algebra test of the year because the yield on 10 year bonds has been shooting up. JPow loves all bulls and wants to see them prosper, and so the Fed will need to do something soon to get 10 year yield under control.

There's been a bunch of speculation about what tools the Fed might use to reduce yield - Yield Curve Control, Operation Twist etc. You can look up all that shit yourself. But no matter the strategy 10 year yields will need to fall for JPow to save his beloved bull children.

So what do we do? It's simple - bet on the Fed. $IEF is an ETF that tracks 7-10 year treasuries. I know it's confusing, but when yields go _up_, $IEF and other bond ETFs go _down_. When yields go _down_, where does $IEF go? I have nary a wrinkle on my brain and even I can figure it out - they go _up_.

When the Fed first announced infinite QE in March, the 10 year yield dropped to the 0.5% - 0.6% range. IEF reached $123 based on that drop in yield. If the Fed announces yield curve control in particular and targets a rate in that range, we'd expect to see IEF trade up to $123 again. You can see the price history [here](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/IEF/overview), and compare it to the yields on the 10 year [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countryCode=BX)

Why put even a half of a half of a percent into $IEF over any of your meme stocks? Why buy into this boomer crap? _IV on IEF options is super super low_. For the smoothest of brains sitting in the last row, that means you pay very little money per contract, and _any_ increase in volatility makes the price shoot up, possibly without your option even getting ITM. Today you could have bought the bond version of an FD and gotten a 3/19 123c for _3 cents_. If IEF goes up by $2, that option will be worth _at least_  13 cents, and that's assuming IV doesn't increase at all. If we go to that $123 level quickly due to YCC being announced this week and IV jumps to 30%, that option is worth almost $3 - _a 100x gain_.

Additionally, it seems someone else had this idea first. The open interest on some of these strikes is already pretty high for 3/19, as you can see here: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IEF/options?p=IEF&date=1616112000

There's a downside here - if the Fed does nothing, or the Fed does something and markets refuse to react to it, these calls will 100% expire worthless - there's no chance of a gamma squeeze, short squeeze, squeeze bottle, catalysts or any of that shit. This play is 100% based on fundamentals and Fed action. 

**TLDR** - If you think the Fed will make 10 year yield go down, $IEF calls are a super high leverage bet on specifically that thing happening

Positions: Nothing yet as this only occurred to my dumb ass this evening, but at market open I'm buying IEF 4/16 116c to be responsible and IEF 3/19 123c to be a gambling degenerate. 

Additionally before anyone tries to accuse me of shilling fucking _bonds_ of all things, I have enough GME shares to buy at least 10 full nights from your mother and I'm not selling any of them.",1614861135.0

14023,$OCGN - Why this Ticker Deserves $20 By Friday,lxc3fb,"Hello Fellas, 

I’m sure most of you have had your focus on taxes, GME, RKT, AMC or whatever else which is highly respectable works. I’ve been a lurker here since around Fall of 2020 If i’m correct and have finally decided to spread a good cause.

Today, I come to write up a storm about how Ocugen is still undervalued, not in wants of a meme moment but in want of true investors who are willing to learn more about this very promising company and reap staggering rewards.

Earlier this morning Ocugen’s partner for a COVID-19 Vaccine, Bharat Biotech released their “Interim Phase III Data” in other words the effectiveness to their vaccine. Coming in at %81 it surpassed Johnson & Johnson measly %66. Although markets have been awfully red me and the other $OCGN believers saw a massive premarket volume topping off at 10AM (45% Gain) But me and many others alike are not simply looking to day trade this stock or swing it...

Ocugen's Covaxin focuses on preventing COVID-19, not reducing hospitalizations. This is far superior to 
$NVAX, $JNJ and others. It also works just as effectively against the mutant variants. Pretty Powerful.

The news of Phase III Data was not suppose to drop for a week or so, but it came as a surprise today. Unluckily the shorts did bleed the ever living fuck out of Ocugen today while market sentiment was lower.

Personally I missed out on the gains from February but I am sticking to this stock because it is the only one that I truly believe in. Very enticing PR is right around the corner. OCGN/Bharat Biotech intend on getting EUA + FDA Approval this same month.

The fact that OCGN still finished green today when almost everything else in their sector was red as well as every index, says something. 

You could argue that the top of Ocugen has already been met at $18 a few weeks back... Though let us not forget that the ticker only saw a $2 Gain on its news of a vaccine partnership, and two days later rocketed to $18. I surely believe something very similar can most definitely happen this week.

India, France, and Brazil are onboard as well. Ocugen is based in Pennsylvania for any wondering and has had people on the case to push this out ASAP. 

Covaxin is cheaper, making its way toward children testing, the Indian Prime Minister took this days before any Phase III results were published.

Nevertheless, OCGN is not only a COVID play that has massive upside potential but also a leader in treating blindness. OCU400 is a drug they’ve manufactured to regain sight in the blind or restoring clarity in eyes.

14030,"GME DD, HF can't cover their short by the call options!",lxbw9p,"Disclaim Not financial advice!

First, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.

I see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.

If we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.

I see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.

First, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.

Even they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .

Then let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.

I didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.

So, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.

Please correct me if I have any mistakes.

Position, 104@110

EDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   💎💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.

Take everything about GME on here with a grain of salt, and make decisions on your investments based on your own assessment/analysis. With that said, did an ape-level trend comparison of the current price trend with the trend from the short squeeze. There are certainly many variables that have changed significantly since then. Whichever direction the stock wants to go from here, I just think it's hilarious how similar they appear to me.

If the trends diverge in the future, let this post be an example of confirmation bias!

14040,Gamestop 1/27 Options Trading,lxbmid,"Quick question to everyone that was involved, on the morning of the 27th, were you able to trade options at 9:30 am?

I have a trade dispute with my broker and they are claiming that the primary market didn't open until 9:43 am and trading options a few seconds after that at a price of $297 which is when I could sell. However, I show on NYSE and Gamestop's investor relations that the opening price was $354.

I was up and active in the pre-market watching the price and when open happened I was unable to sell my options until \~15 minutes later. I saw volume on the ticker during those times and the price of the options change on other brokerage platforms.

If anyone knows of any website with historical options trade information or at the very least can corroborate what I saw (maybe even trade data) I would greatly appreciate it. The dispute is for a large sum and I don't want to have to go FINRA arbitration.

**Edit: Due to my low karma I am unable to directly reply to the comments. I want to assert that they are trying to say that the NASDAQ did not open until 9:43 AM EST and I believe that to be false based on other brokerage price action (Robinhood/Webull).**

&#x200B;

**Edit 2: I did some digging based on** u/meta-cognizant **suggestion of marketchameleon. I downloaded the options transaction log for 01/27/2021 and to my surprise my brokerage is 100% absolutely correct which blew my mind. Options did not start trading until 9:43:52 AM.**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Brokerage was correct and options activity was not started until 09:43:52 AM EST on 01/27/2021.**",1614857527.0

14042,Theory on why GME is showing weird numbers on order book,lxbj9i,"🚨My theory on order book showing high numbers 🚨

 

**Obligatory**

**This isn't a trading advice nor am I a financial advisor. You do your own trades and make your own decision about your investment. This is just for educational purposes only.**

According to this article on order book I just skimmed over, [http://www.personal.psu.edu/qxc2/research/jfuturesmarkets-2008.pdf](http://www.personal.psu.edu/qxc2/research/jfuturesmarkets-2008.pdf)

"" *order book is moderately informative—its contribution to price discovery is approximately 22%. The remaining 78% is from the best bid and offer prices on the book and the last transaction price.* ""

It's been said that the 80% of the current market is traded by Algos.

I believe Algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons.

1. Crazy amount of short interest
2. HF's are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist.
3. WSB retards are putting $69,420 for sell orders which are fucking up the HFT traders.

1.

It is estimated that retail holds about MINIMUM 30-40% of the float (estimation of 4 million people around the world holding just 3 shares each.) and institutions hold **122.04%** according to yahoo. Short % of the float is about 60% of the float which means around 25million shares are borrowed and sold on the market.

If half of GME holders and half of institutions are **💎🙌** s that means about 80% of the float is locked in **💎🙌** . This makes short interest waaaaaay higher than what is actually reported. If short interest is 60% which is 25million and float is 20% of the actual float, that makes the short interest **277%.** There's just not enough shares for short seller to cover because most of the shares are just fucking locked in.

2.

So these HF's who have to cover due to either share recall or losing money, they make up counterfeit shares from their off-shore account to buy the counterfeited shares and covering them. That way they can trick the fail-to-deliver numbers and show the SEC that they ""covered"" using shares that don't even fucking exist. (read this webpage on counterfeiting shares that I just skimmed over to get an overview of how counterfeiting stocks is done. [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=Naked%20Short%20%E2%80%94%20This%20is%20an,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=Naked%20Short%20%E2%80%94%20This%20is%20an,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).)

I believe they have gotten to a point where there are **literally close to 0 Shares available on the market to cover** and this is fucking with the algos because the reason number 3.

3.

WSB retards are putting $800-$69,420 orders and Algos are trying to get the lowest priced shares to cover short selling for HF's while skimming through non-existent shares that are currently being traded on the market but it obviously doesn't all go through because HF's probably have some another Algo to prevent some weird anomaly shit from happening. Now they can't cover at those numbers or they'd be out of money in 5 minutes. (Similar event actually happened back in 2012 where HFT made a company called Knight Capital to lose $440m in just 45 minutes [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19214294](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19214294) In summary the Algos just started buying high and selling low lol) So what do they do? they have to make fake shares again until either retail or institutions sell their locked up shares.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk now I'll take any questions.

**TLDR.**

I believe Algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons.

1. Crazy amount of short interest
2. HF's are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist.
3. WSB retards are putting $69,420 for sell orders which are fucking up the HFT traders.",1614857210.0

# Some arbitrary statistics.

$RKT started off with a 10% daily gain on 2/26 while SPY dropped from $384-380 ($4)

TODAY $SKT went up 10% while SPY slid from $385.5 to $381.5 ($4)

Avg daily volume was 3m, [TODAY IT WAS 17 MILLION](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/)

&#x200B;

COINCIDENCE, I THINK NOT.

# Quarterly Dividend of 4.33%

A quarterly dividend of 4.33% is in itself very healthy and suggests solid foundations in the balance sheet.

# BUT CHECK THIS OUT...

&#x200B;

$RKT announced a $1.11 special dividend, leading to the glorious mooning.

$RKT traded at roughly $23-25 following the dividend announcement

GUESS WHAT. MATH SAYS $1.11/$24 IS $4.6%.

**STOCK TRADING SOMEWHAT NEAR $20. DIVIDEND OF ROUGHLY 4.5%. 10% GAIN WHILE $SPY DROPS $4. HMMMMMMMMMMM**

A BUNCH OF LINES ON A RECTANGLE. WTF DOES THIS EVEN MEAN?

**Here is an** **easy chart** for you dum-dums that can't read. I can't be bothered to scale the graph properly, just add a 1 in front of every number greater than 18 and then we have our actual targets. Here we have a neat little triangle pennant thing (play button for those who are high IQ enough to play beer pong) with a STRONG upward breakout followed by some standard consolidation. I expect similar movement in the following days until another, much more ""massive cock energy"" jump. Again, pay no mind to the stupid scaling. It'll be more like 18 -> 40 -> 80 -> Valhalla (ask me anything about Norse mythology, I dare you).

&#x200B;

Here are some more charts or something. Look at all these calls. IV is still relatively low compared to what it can get to.

&#x200B;

[look at this shit](https://preview.redd.it/6wdahzh3axk61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4133be6f543d2746fea506918802c9d5a99080e2)

Any option (call or put) can be a bagger here just based off the low IV alone. If IV reaches near GME/AMC/BB/SKT levels, they can triple in value regardless of direction.

&#x200B;

Also as a note, Texas just opened up EVERYTHING. I live in Los Angeles where EVERYTHING is open ANYWAYS you just have to wear a mask unless you're eating, even if you're sitting 2 inches from some random person.

Shopping centers and malls are operating anyways and it can only go up from here for them. Biden said everyone's getting vaccinated by May (I just got mine today hehe). J&J is getting approved, more vaccines are coming. IT LITERALLY CAN'T GO TITS UP.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Read the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwvvfn/skt_skt_why_tanger_outlets_has_the_most_potential/) and look at these graphs. $SKT will pimp out my girlfriend.

I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**

First full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:

1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.
2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.

* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more ""normal"" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.

3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.

* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.

TL;DR **my opinion**

1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)
2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD > ""insert ticker"" DD
3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME
4. There is no #4, this was a test

And that's my two cents.",1614846293.0

14145,The modern day witch-hunt that has become WSB and a plea for the revival of the old WSB.,lx86md,"It’s quite obvious that since January there has been a MASSIVE influx of new members to WSB. As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I’m concerned about how that’s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.

Nowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don’t mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. 

AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY. WHILE GAMESTOP💎🙌🏿 IS A GREAT VEHICLE TO DO THAT, IT IS NOT THE ONLY MEANS OF MAKING MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.

While I am saying all this, there really isn’t any real way (that I can think of at least) to remedy this issue and this post probably won’t get the publicity and visibility that it needs to make a change. However, I want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there. Long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain OPEN MINDED. Allow there to be room on the sub for genuinely great ideas to grow and flourish and receive the attention they deserve. Stay safe y’all.",1614845673.0

Okay hear me out. This is assuming you are investing in companies and not simply trading stocks for quick profits. Obviously short-term traders use price charts in all kinds of fancy ways to make their money. It seems like astrology to me, but apparently enough people are making a living off of day trading so I won't comment further on that.

Investing in companies isn't necessarily 'long-term'. It just usually ends up being long-term because companies tend to make more money over time, not less, so selling early is generally dumb.

With these boundary conditions established we can get to my point.

Whatever price an asset was in the past says nothing about what the price of it should be today. Therefore, price charts are useless for determining the true value of a stock.

Consider an ideal whore at room temperature. It costs $5 to sleep with her. Yesterday it would have cost $10 to sleep with her. The reason for this price difference is unknown to the market in general, and can only be speculated upon. Does the fact that the price is different have any bearing on your decision to sleep with her? It shouldn't. Here are some conditions you might use to make an informed choice on your financial decision:

* Do you have $5 to spend?

* Is there something more valuable to you, for whatever reason, that you can pay the same $5 for?

* Does she have any STDs?

* Does she have any semblance of a personality?

* Etc.

Now, you might think, 'Well it used to be $10. I only have $5 now and it might go up in the future!' That type of thinking is dumb. You literally have no idea why the price difference was there. You can speculate, but it's only that: speculation. This type of thinking is inherently irrational, and by allowing it into your decision process you are adding noise to your signal, taking away mental processing on considering the types of questions such as the ones listed above.

So how does this relate back to stocks? We can value stocks the same way. Everyone has his own valuation strategy. I look at earnings, the company's capacity to grow, the market's capacity to grow, whether the company's guidance is conservative or aggressive, etc. When I do this, the price chart doesn't fucking help me at all. The reason is because this chart doesn't actually give me any useful information beyond what a historical price was. This is because price correlates with too many things, and we can't break that down to specific indicators that we can actually play upon. In essence, price charts are more noise than signal. When you decide to buy or sell a stock, you should be basing it on the current price and your valuation model. If you allow yourself to start rationalizing decisions based on price movements, you're playing yourself by allowing emotional, irrational thinking to become involved (astrology). Again, if you're day trading, that's totally different, and theoretically day traders use other tools like volume to make their decisions, not just price charts.

So what does this have to do with retards on WSB? It means stop looking at fucking price charts and selling your shit too early, or buying shit just because 'the stock is cheap right now'. Know what the fuck you're doing, or just blindly follow one of the smart retards like DFV. Either of those things are going to be better than 'taking a profit' or 'buying the dip' on stocks you know nothing about. Don't allow yourself to get into emotional voodoo by looking for signs through price charts. Instead, look at indicators that have better defined causation: earnings, dividends, debt, news, etc.

Supplemental information:

Price charting is analogous to the following, in my retarded opinion:

* Astrology

* Biblical numerology

* Divination

* Flat earth beliefs

* Young earth creationism

* Feng shui

* Crystal healing

* Myers–Briggs Type Indicator

* Scientific racism

* Social Darwinism

* Parapsychology

* Anything from MRA movements

* General theory of relativity

* Etc.",1614842712.0

**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)

---

**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.

---
**Analysis**

Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 

* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 
* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.

&nbsp;

Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).

&nbsp;

**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 

* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float
* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze
* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)
* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions

&nbsp;

As of 3/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **>$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **>11.5m**

14229,E-Commerce Stock hiding behind legacy mail meter business PBI Pitney Bowes,lx6m8b,"So I found this from a Choice Capital Management letter and it does a good job of explaining how it is in a sense another Gamestop type stock that is misunderstood and has been thrown out.  


PBI – Pitney Bowes, Inc. embodies several characteristics that seem to show up in many of our investments. Overlooked. Unloved. Misunderstood. Sometimes all three. Together, these forces have pushed PBI shares lower for years. Of course, it is not too difficult to understand how this came to be the case. The company’s glory days back when it was lauded in Jim Collins’ Good to Great for leasing mail meters and offering presort mail services have long since passed. Though these businesses continue to generate nice cash flows, mailing revenues have steadily declined for years. Consolidated financials are not pretty, with earnings declining consistently for much of the past decade. All this, for a 100-year-old company that – not so affectionately these days – goes by the moniker “the mail company.” But buried within those consolidated financials that paint the picture of a shrinking company, Pitney Bowes has been building a very promising e-commerce business. It has been a long time coming, but after first getting into the business eight years ago with their acquisition of Newgistics, the shipping business appears poised to thrive. Other factors suggest the company’s fortunes may be turning as well. In recent years, the company has gotten serious about turning things around. Management has refocused the company around mailing, shipping and financing. They have sold off a number of non-core segments. In addition to refocusing the company and simplifying the narrative for prospective shareholders, these moves have also enabled the company to improve its balance sheet, with the majority of debt now supporting the company’s financing business. So now, “the mail company” is shipping, financing and mailing, with the emphasis on shipping. The Global Ecommerce business is promising. It serves a capacity-constrained segment of the economy that enjoys natural tailwinds from a package delivery market that has been growing steadily at a midteens annual rate for years. Its principal focus is on Domestic Parcel Delivery. Here it focuses on the middle mile, retrieving packages from small and medium size businesses and delivering them to the USPS, who handles final mile delivery. It also offers Cross-Border Solutions and Shipping Solutions, with a primary emphasis on offering transparent and easy to understand pricing models to its growing customer base. Before the pandemic, there were early signs of success. The Global Ecommerce segment had grown to well over $1B in sales, or nearly 40% of the whole company. But like a lot of promising young businesses, it was subscale and unprofitable. In 2019, the segment lost \~$70M, detracting \~$.30 from the company’s $.68 of earnings that year. But the pandemic looks to have accelerated this segment’s push to scale. In Q4 2020, domestic parcels shipped grew a promising 76% over last year. And by growing its top 1000 E-  Page 4 Retailer (page 88) client count from 12 to 63 in 2020, Pitney Bowes just passed DHL and their 32 top 1000 E-Retailer count to move to number four on the list. Volumes are now near levels the company had previously suggested operations could become profitable. But due to a deluge of one-time and unabsorbed costs, the segment is still not profitable. Some costs are COVID related. Some come from unabsorbed warehouse facilities. Others reflect lower operational efficiency than one would expect from a scaled operation. But despite the fact profitability has been pushed out a bit, the company has clearly done the right thing for itself, by doing the right thing for its customers. Accordingly, it is likely to keep these customers, and there is little reason to suggest profitability cannot improve over time as previously envisioned.  


TLDR: People think it's a mail meter stock but shipping is now more than half of their revenue and and they will soon be valued as a fast growing e-comm play. Gamestop OG from Domo Capital is bullish as well",1614840928.0

14246,"$SKT to $200? Might be rarted, might be genius- I'm doing it either way. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",lx6bz0,"Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained 🦍, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.

Let's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \*% short float is at 47.25%!!\*Compared to every other ""meme stock,"" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).

Not to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.

The trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.

Over the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).

All of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since 🌈🐻 are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **✅**

Next, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the ""value"" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **✅**

Not to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **✅**

Where do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask ""wHy It DoNt Go Up,"" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).

So is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.

So help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!

\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.

Ok, now with that out of the way....

The DD seems solid on RKT and seems to mirror GME right before the first big run. Congrats to u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT on his huge YOLO. However, all I hear is that it's a distraction or Shitadel P&D. Don't get me wrong, I'm still HODLing 15k GME for the moon but how isn't this getting more support? Out of 1.98 billion shares, there are only 200k shares available per IBorrowDesk and a reported short float of 37.47% by FINRA.

This tweet from Ihor @ S3 went out earlier today claiming that the short float has now increased to 45.15% and is his top candidate for a squeeze.

*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*

So I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**

Why? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.

Ryan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.

Steam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.

If they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.

A 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572/share.

I'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.

I'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.

Let's fucking go.

***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***. What's past alpha centuri?

**Edit 2:** Loving the discussion this is provoking. As much as I love the memes, it's good to bring up the signs that GME's future outlook makes them extremely undervalued even without the squeeze, but goddamn I am lookin forward to tendies either way 🚀.",1614838982.0

While being extremely annoyed of the consolation ruining my calls (I also hold shares), I thought to myself: Who is one of the largest market makers in the world? 

That’s right, Citadel Securities, and there is an extremely high probability that they are on the other end of these calls, hence the consolidation and IV crush over the past few days. 

With that said, I believe the MM’s (such as Citadel securities) are manipulating the stock to stay under these calls in order to receive their premium in full and also to avoid a gamma squeeze (call OI is much higher than put OI, so a gamma squeeze on the call side would carry much more risk to them).

That said, I would be very cautious buying $GME calls as it appears MM’s headed by Citadel are doing everything and anything they can to avoid such a gamma squeeze. 

In summary, I recommend staying away from calls and instead buying shares.",1614838217.0

14292,Next SHORT - $ROOT,lx5o3z,"Okay hear me out this is more than a “squeeze play” and it’s essentially at its ATL (all time low) since IPO. $ROOT does auto insurance and their business model is pretty enticing. This is where you’ll all have to do your own DD as I have a sick kiddo tonight but want to get this out here to all of you. Let me throw some quick numbers at you.

1. Over 50% short
2. Closer to 52 week low (as mentioned above)
3. 42% held by insiders
4. 39% held by institutions
5. 25m float
6. 364m revenue
7. 1.1B cash on hand
8. ONLY 188m debt

Okay so I know charts and TA might be over your apes heads but go ahead and look at the 6m chart of $ROOT then pull up all time for $LMND and compare the charts. Specifically look at $LMND around Oct 29th and look where $ROOT is currently. $LMND was very comparable in shorts, etc. Though their cash on hand was much lower.


If you appreciate this post, get this out there for everyone. I don’t want this as a distraction from $GME and all your other current plays but.. this is just a beaten down company at it’s all time low with great short interest that has 1/3 of its market cap in cash on hand.",1614838138.0

14309,DD: ASO 🚀🚀🚀GME fuel,lx5epa,"Hopefully you made money from the weed stock bump last month and RKT this week. The following is ASO DD and why it could take GME to the next level based on reinvesting gains. Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) beat last quarters earnings by 2.X times predictions. My thesis involves a run up to the Q4 earnings report March 31. Besides the company consistently outperforming market expectations it currently sits as the third most shorted stock (under GME and Tanger).

Since the pandemic began gun and ammo sales have been going through the roof. You may think this would be a negative factor going forward as things calm down but January 2021 had the 3rd highest gun sales record in history. Ammo stocks have seen a boost but then a drop as they report they cannot keep up with supply.

Hunting, fishing, camping, kayaking and other outdoor hobbies have seen a huge increase since the pandemic began, this shit ain't over fokes and we know how much autists spend on new hobbies.

Texas is ""opening back up"" and eliminating the mask mandate. Texas has almost 10% of the US population and they love guns, ammo and the outdoors. ASO is going to be absolutely packed. On top of that, they're all about to receive that sweet stimey money and it sure isn't going into investments. This will undoubtably create positive sentiment articles. 

So this all sounds like a long term bull case right? Wrong. ASO has seen huge spikes in 2021, as have most of the most heavily shorted stocks. This one has the financials and positive momentum to keep it going. If it garners enough interest, as RKT did, a pop is bound to happen as people see the value.

How does this affect GME? Have you seen the posts of people reinvesting gains from RKT and weed stocks? This is the next stop on the road to the moon. P.S. I'm drunk on tendies so excuse misspellings, grammar and lack of charts.",1614837382.0

14349,The revival of ROCK HANDS,lx4v6o,"Lurker just wanting to add a little to the discussion  (excuse not adopting the lingo, I don't post often).

 I'm no financial advisor so don't take my word and such, but I do remember before the GME craze there was a term called rock hands for the people who could stand a beating but still come out on top because their DD was sound. An example I can give to everyone now to understand, is say you bought into GME at 200, averaged down to 90 (when it hovered in the 40s for a week), then sold at 180 when it bounced back. I'd say that was a rock hand play. You came in high, averaged down, then still 2X your money, brovo. (I guess disclaimer, I hold GME and got in way before you). 

I know it's cool now to say paper hand this and paper hand that, but if you ain't making no money or losing a lot of money I'm not sure why you on a betting subreddit. Make big moves but not dumb moves. Not every hand is a diamond hand play, infact a diamond hand play is ultra rare. You gonna find a lot of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x plays rather than the say 10X or more.....Or you might lose it all, who knows. But without a DD you really are a retard and more than likely bout to get your pockets ran. 

But as I said im just a lurker, i'm not trying to sway anyone to buy or sell anything. I'm just reminiscing about the other forgotten hand. Make some money fellas, it's a lot of rock handed plays out there. But keep digging deep until you find that diamond hand play for sure. I'm out.",1614835795.0

14408,$SDC Upcoming Earnings & High Short Interest,lx3jwu,"Hello fellow Autists,

Since we've all been interested in high short interest stocks for possible squeeze events. One thing came up on my radar called $SDC (Smile Direct Club). They are a teledentistry platform that provides member's with a customized clear aligner therapy treatment in the United States and internationally. 

The company took a pretty big hit in revenue during the pandemic last year but has been recovering over the past few quarters, I'll leave chart for dumb dumb's below.

https://preview.redd.it/yd94oxoigvk61.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2755552fe51f5c43407cf876a69dcd39158db62c

Given that before the pandemic they were trading at 16 - 20 dollars a share which I believe is totally undervalued given the fact that they just got a deal with MetLife a major insurance company in November. The company should be on a one way ticket to tendie town. 

&#x200B;

The short interest on this company is massive: 25% of the entire stock is short which I'll leave a screen cap below for proof

https://preview.redd.it/sj1019bhgvk61.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac227daed495234ba08ccc2b02c919e551aec93

One final note, our good friends at Citadel have also decided to join in on the fun for shorting the company, I'll leave a screen cap of their most recent 13F form, but wouldn't it be hilarious if they take yet another L when it comes to WSB and high short interest stocks. (Yes I know it was Melvin Capitol who held the position for GME but still involved with RH on the trade shutdown).

Transocean (RIG) is one of the oil stocks that rallied well today, not until when it reached around 4.0950, a giant candle with huge volume was dumped on the stock at around 12:20pm. The short seller shorted a little more at 2.05pm and 2.30pm, both are very obvious with high volume. With oil price being this high and oil stocks being this bullish, we can easily squeeze this high. And RIG is good at squeezing, just look at its **300%+ squeeze** back in 4-8 June 2020.

14447,DRAINING THE SWAMP - GME NOTABLE HIRES,lx2n82,"Necessary disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor and I have no idea what I'm talking about, I just like the stock 🚀🚀🚀 

&#x200B;

Long ago when DFV started preaching the GME bull case, he saw it as a value buy. He did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store. When people compared Gamestop to Blockbuster, he laughed.

Since Gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention, he has been under a microscope. Billions of dollars see him as the leader, and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for. Everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal, but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons. Given the wave of new hires, I thought now would be a good time to formally discuss the company's mid to long term potential.

&#x200B;

**The Ryan Cohen Vision**

If you have any money in Gamestop, you better already know this part. That being said, you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again.

Ryan Cohen founded Chewy in 2011 and served as the CEO until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3B. This marked the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company and speaks to RC's expertise in e-commerce. This man is the messiah.

&#x200B;

On 11/16/20, Cohen formally wrote a letter to the Gamestop board of directions, detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it. Within it, he discussed:

\- The growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer

\- The large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program

\- Gamestop's unwillingness to change with the times

\- Gamestop's hardships amid the 'gaming boom'

&#x200B;

His letter made it clear that he has a vision for what Gamestop could be, and that he has a plan to get it there. He recently upped his stake from 9-12.91% on 1/12/21, which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround. If we have any chance of making it to valhalla, Ryan Cohen will lead us.

&#x200B;

**Draining the swamp**

As Cohen expressed in his letter, one of the main reasons for Gamestop's fall was its lack of competent leadership. The ship has been sinking for years, and its crew has been suspiciously negligent. While conspiracy theories exist that Gamestop execs tanked the company in an effort to insider trade with hedge funds, we'll keep the tinfoil hats off today.

*Jim Bell- Former CFO*

On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Jim Bell, CFO, would be 'resigning'. Myself and many others believe that he was forced out by the new wave, which is supported by [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-is-surging-again-and-no-one-can-say-why-51614208357). His background shows he worked primarily with brick and mortar establishments which won't be relevant for the RC vision.

&#x200B;

*New board nominees -* [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html)

On January 11th, 2021, it was announced that Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, and Jim Grube are new nominees for the board of directors. They stand up for election at the ""annual meeting of stockholders"" which is expected to take place in June 2021.

&#x200B;

[Alan Attal - Former Chewy CMO and COO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-attal)

One of Cohen's Chewy buddies, Attal will serve a valuable role in Gamestop's transformation to the digital age. He specializes in e-commerce, marketing, and could help tapping into Gamestop's 55 million customers registered to their rewards program.

&#x200B;

Ryan Cohen - The Messiah

Enough said

&#x200B;

[Jim Grube Former Chewy CFO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-grube-7141931)

Grube specializes in e-commerce which is especially crucial for Gamestop's current situation. While has not yet been appointed CFO of Gamestop, I find him to be the most likely candidate. If so, he will be tasked with the trainwreck that is Gamestop.

&#x200B;

*Board nominees likely not up for re-election*

Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck. I'm too lazy to get into detail here but these people are dead weight and do not seem to align with the Cohen vision.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Other notable hires**

*Matt Francis - CTO*

Francis began working for GameStop on 2/15/21. He has worked in the e-commerce industry for more than two decades and recently worked with Amazon Web Services. He could play a big role in the modernization of Gamestop's business model. [source](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer) \- [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis)

&#x200B;

*Kelli Durkin - Senior VP of Customer Care*

Durkin began working for Gamestop on 3/1/21 and was part of the RC Chewy cohort. She will bring her world-class customer service operation to Gamestop and could help to tap into the large customer base that was mentioned earlier. - [her linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelli-durkin-4552229)

&#x200B;

*Josh Kreuger- Vice President of Fulfillment*

Krueger previously worked for Amazon and Walmart, and began working on 3/1/21. His job is especially critical as Gamestop's ability to fulfill orders in a timely fashion will ultimately determine their ability to compete with competitors. - [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-krueger-b80ba03a)

&#x200B;

**Notable differences**

As many of you have pointed out, Gamestop has already made a few concrete changes which is quite impressive. They now offer same-day delivery to many locations by utilizing doordash. They were able to tap into a stable network and instantly made themselves a competitor. They have also added many pc parts such as gfx cards to their website. While it may be too soon for these new hires to have caused these changes, they are first-steps in making Gamestop the powerhouse that it once was.

TLDR: Lots of good new hires, and bad people being let down. I like the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀




COMMENT FROM u/talascio points out:
“The next big GME move to look out for is probably going to be the current CEO George Sherman ""resigning""

Before becoming the CEO of GameStop, Sherman was the CEO of Victra, a Verizon retailer that runs brick and mortar Verizon stores.

His tenure at Victra was extremely short, leading me to believe he wasn't the easiest person to work with and found a home in the pre-Cohen GameStop swamp.  Not to mention that a CEO that specializes in B&M locations is the polar opposite of the future vision for GME.

The news that Sherman has ""resigned"" is going to be an insane catalyst, things are only looking good from here on out”",1614829698.0

14474,TURN OFF INSTANT SETTLEMENTS and LEAVE ROBINHOOD!,lx1xrm,"Robinhood is lending your shares to shorters. Don't believe me? 

How's about this, from Reuters, yesterday: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle-idUSKCN2AU2EP

But you have margin turned off! But you have a sell limit set for $69,420.69! IT DOESN'T MATTER. 

INSTANT SETTLEMENTS is what needs to be TURNED OFF. They even hide it away, under profile>menu>investing>DAY TRADE SETTINGS. 

On top of that, THEY DO NOT LET YOU TURN IT OFF IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING DEPOSITS OR HAVE TRADED IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. 

That's the cost of instant settlements. Sure, you get to trade quicker, but you also allow them to trade AGAINST you, and WITH YOUR OWN SHARES.

Can't turn off instant settlements, don't want to be stuck in limbo for a full brokerage transfer, and determined to escape? What can be done?

Well, my fellow smooth-brained ape, I'll tell you what I'm doing:

The following steps assume you are invested primarily in shares of a company, not options. EACH OF THESE STEPS WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

First, open an account at a different brokerage. Make sure it's a cash-account (for some brokerages, like WeBull, etc., YOU MUST OPT-OUT OF SHARE LENDING). With a cash-account, you'll have to sit patiently for settlement of funds from selling shares before you can withdraw those funds or reinvest (but, let's be honest, you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't already patient). I use Fidelity, which is a cash-account by default with several opt-in programs to take advantage of down the line. 

Second, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, transfer/deposit money into your new brokerage from your bank (or wherever else you usually get your money to trade with). If GME is your sole play, and you can afford it, try to deposit around the same amount your GME shares in Robinhood are currently worth. 

Once your deposit is completed (no longer ""pending""), wait for a small dip in the price and buy in with your new broker. 

When the purchase is complete, you can go into Robinhood and sell your shares (ideally, at the same or slightly higher price than you just bought them for at your new brokerage).

Wait out the next few trading days of your Robinhood account and DO NOT TRADE VIA ROBINHOOD. If you trade, you risk resetting the clock on your Withdrawable Cash. You do your trading with your new brokerage from now on. Withdraw your cash from Robinhood ASAP and put it back in your bank account, pay back your wife's boyfriend, or whatever.

Now, if Robinhood wants to keep any short deals they had on your shares, THEY have to hold onto the shares, themselves. Every 1 share you were holding away from shorters (ineffectively), has now become 2 shares (1 effectively, 1 ineffectively). That, or Robinhood actually does sell the shares, which increases the length of the short chain and the costs associated with holding that position.. Thus, shorting attempts are made more expensive and less sustainable. 

Meanwhile, you'll be back to holding your shares without your broker selling them behind your back. 

TLDR: Don't let your diamond hands be sold by the pawn shop that's storing them. Getting out of Robinhood not only helps you, but also hinders the shorts. Two birds with one stone. Power to the players.

Obligatory, not financial advice, not an adviser or professional, do your own research, yadayada. 

If I'm wrong about anything in the above, do not be surprised, but please let me know what it might be. If my foundation is rotted, please kick my case over before anyone even considers moving in. Thanks.",1614827841.0
14475,How I use WSB (A NOOB's take on r/WSB),lx1x5s,"I've been trading stocks very passively since Robinhood became available. I would watch a little CNBC, try to identify bargains, then purchase some stock and try to ignore it. Now, I am trading actively every day. I'm a full-time undergraduate math student, and I just got accepted into a graduate program, so it's pretty likely that I will be back to doing passive investing by Fall 2021. FYI I might be studying math finance.

I first heard about WSB through my buddy who started getting into options when we got our stimulus last June. His take was that he was too poor for $1200 to matter very much and that if the economy tanked that wouldn't do him very much good. I think he was pretty actively engaged, made about $5000. I know he's still around here, but he has a regular job so I doubt he's as active as he was back then.

Trading is work. It's kind of like being in business for yourself, a bit like being a professional gambler, and I don't think any of these things means it deserves any stigma. There are psychological labor and decision fatigue and it stays with you after the markets close and on the weekends. I started drinking more and started using a little more THC. None of these things are of major concern: I don't consider my day trading or substance use any kind of addiction.

I joined WSB when GME was popping off. I had been paying attention to the news but didn't buy in till it was about $350 on that Wednesday. Yes WSB influenced my decision, so did the YouTuber In The Money, but I don't think anybody could have predicted the way in which the squeeze was going to be kneecapped that next morning.

I stayed on WSB, trying to figure out the good info from the bad info. I posted to another website about GME. When GME stabilized around $50 I was down $6k, not to mention the fact I had sold my MJ stocks to buy GME (I really should've used cash which I could've deposited).

I didn't really let any of this get to me. We all have our reasons for wanting to make money. IMO it was worth the risk, which is why I'm still here. However, if I want to keep trading, I can't YOLO my money into a meme stock - I'm a student with no income.

So I started getting more serious about options trading. I don't do high probability trading, I just look at charts and buy options based on which direction the price is moving. I've seen videos about the Greeks, but I really don't pay that close attention to things other than the bid-ask spread and IV. I like options because they're leveraged and I can make money on bearish positions.

How does WSB fit into my trading strategy? I look for meme stocks, read the DD, and then look at the chart. If I like the chart I might try a trade, if I don't like it I might ignore it or add it to a watchlist. It's pretty simple and it's helped me identify many profitable trades.

I comment on stuff in the daily thread, sometimes I answer a question. I shit post a little. I call out BS but I don't push my gay af communism on y'all. This is the only Reddit I am on and the only social media I'm on is Mastadon and a few discord channels.

If you've read this, you probably aren't someone constantly screaming in the Daily. If you're new here like me please don't fuck it up. Stop screaming in the daily thread about every little movement of your meme stock. The risk is that we eventually need stricter gatekeeping and that's very intensive and difficult. We might even be targeted by regulators which would make Wall Street very happy.

One final mention is about information security. Infosec is about keeping private info private and public info accurate. I can guarantee you that we have the attention of every major intelligence apparatus (private, public, government, etc) watching what we're doing. There are shills, influencers, bots and bad-actors. This is just a part of any public movement. If you want to read about the way state's organize their counter-intelligence efforts, here's a link to a Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence\_missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence_missions)

Thanks for taking the time to read, I hope that this has been a helpful perspective on WSB from a noob. Go bers!",1614827797.0

With all this shit that the average retail investor is bringing to Wall Street, they are probably doing everything that can to cause the next crash for multiple reasons. One... they lost a shit ton of money all thanks to WSB apes. So they would like to get stock cheap since they are broke AF. Second, a crash would scare Uncle Bill and all the other paper hands back to their “safe” managed funds. The point of all this? Not to be scared... keep fighting the good fight.

If we become rich, we take over the golfing scene. If we don't, hedge funds will always be golfers. Also, NBA Top Shot collectibles (NFT bullshit) are in a crazy demand rn and that just dropped 2-3 months ago.

But when I tried to post an update, it kept getting automodded.

As an update: I took profits on my last play and am now re-allocating them. This is my 1st new play.

&#x200B;

$NOK got a LOT of love when the first $GME spike happened. It got so much love that it popped to nearly 10$/share before RH blocked trading.

Since then, volume's come down, attention has gone away from the stock, this has made options quite appealing.

IV's down significantly and calls are REALLY cheap.

My DD:

* They delivered SOLID Q4 and 2020 earnings, even though it was a tough year in general.
* The company owns the **most** pattents in the 5G space of all it's peers.
* Huauei is being blacklisted in most of the western world, there are only 2 players remaining in the space, Ericcson and Nokia.
* The company is sitting on nearly $8 billion in cash and generates over a billion a year in free cash flow.
* The stock is trading at only 1.5x book value
* They have been increasing the profit margins significantly for the last 3 years and are working towards improving them even more.
* Nokia has announced several solid deals over the past few weeks.

&#x200B;

* **The company is small enough that it could be an M&A target** 
   * The US Attorney General William Barr [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-department-justices-china) the US -- either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies -- should purchase a controlling stake in either Nokia or Ericsson for access to secure 5G equipment. He said such a move could blunt the rise of China and Huawei in the space. 
   * AT&T / Tmobile / another carrier could buy them to lower their own costs of updating to 5/6G.
   * Intel and Microsoft are both focusing heavily on the space and Microsoft already bought part of Nokia in the past.

&#x200B;

* There's also the potential for them to reinstate their dividend payment policy.

&#x200B;

* Average analyst price target is 5.75$
* Over the last 10 years, it's been rangebound between 4 and 8$, it's pretty much at the bottom of the range.
* I'm confident it'll be back to 5 or 6$ by the summer, especially if they keep announcing these solid deals.

Positions: 20 000 shares and 100x 6$ calls sold against them for april 16th.

TLDR: Nokia's a great medium-long term play, IV's down significantly, shares and calls are cheap. This will probably bounce from 4$ back towards 6-8$ over the medium term, or be bought out as a strategic play, likely for over 6$.

[Comments](https://preview.redd.it/baa7ritypuk61.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6b8eab6ff5519aac82a87a06e742d52aa74440e)

&#x200B;

The goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if I can provide a base for it. The theory in question is “$RKT discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $GME”. A TLDR of my analysis is:

**A) Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB.**

**B) Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT**

**C) There are a small, but non-zero, number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME. However, this is done with no relation to $RKT.**

**D) Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**

Through my analysis I wasn’t able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME. While it’s easy to complain about u/zjz's iron-fisted bot army, I think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation.

Now I will provide the data backing up these conclusions, and call out one account I did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion.

&#x200B;

**Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB. Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT.**

I don’t think I need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently. Obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters, and that’s fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $GME and $RKT first joined the wsb community. The motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $GME.

The average $RKT poster first posted on wsb on December 10th, 2020. This is pretty shockingly young, but the average $GME poster is even newer to the community with an average date of December 22nd, 2020.

Here are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community, by year:

[RKT Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/qp652yp7quk61.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc3b954aea59a00e2a3f0e570b825e614c0cec0)

&#x200B;

**There is a non-zero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME, but not enough to have a significant effect.**

One other thing I examined was how much different accounts were shilling $GME and $RKT. For the most part, there wasn’t too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions. Below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined WSB on the x-axis and the number of times they have mentioned $GME/$RKT in the last 5 days on the y-axis.

[$GME date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/g9vgmq6gquk61.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=73571b1836771fc0c8fa3c80eebd738d13bd5d9b)

[$RKT date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/0a8xwqlkquk61.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e79bb797abbdf49eb43b4c7fd94c4541c6d58b)

There are 3 prominent outliers that I will examine, one of which I think probably deserves some sort of moderator action. On the $GME graph we have /u/char1101g way out in the upper right. He just started posting on here yesterday, and has been just absolutely spamming anti-GME shit since. Although posts like ""SELL YOU GME STOCK"" seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a short-only investor, I don't really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial anti-GME push.

On the $RKT side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people, so I don’t want to call them out by username. While I’d say they’re pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts (old accounts, lots of personal info, lots of non-wsb posts), they’re absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads, with dozens of comments already today. You could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $RKT all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion, but given that it’s just two random dudes I kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things.

**Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**

The last thing I wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $GME and $RKT. In particular, I wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly. I ended up not finding much of a significant difference. Below is a table where $GME/$RKT accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock.

&#x200B;

|Mentions of $RKT/$GME over last 5 days|$RKT accounts|$GME accounts|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\>1|.806|.801|
|\>2|.653|.657|
|\>5|.454|.433|
|\>10|.331|.310|

&#x200B;

There's a pretty small overlap (34%) between people talking about $GME and people talking about $RKT, likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen, but from my research I wasn't able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME.  That being said, I'm happy to hear criticisms on my work, let me know below if you have any thoughts.",1614824428.0

But some people want to add some liquidity to their physical silver assets, so they can tie up more of their savings into silver, instead of holding fiat which may continue to experience inflation.  

That's where GameStop brand silver ATM machines come into play. GameStop stock is going to the moon regardless, and needs some kind of new shtick to stay relevant. Imagine an ATM machine that buys silver 1oz coins at spot price and sells them for enough of a premium to keep the machines running.

This will liquify silver, the original money, and should steer us toward eliminating fiat. Physical silver becomes the new savings and cash, and both it and GME go to moontown. I think it's coming, eventually.  Thanks to the subreddit and please I hope you don't ban me again, I'm not talking about SLV, that's a scam. I'm talking about physical silver and GameStop recognizing this revolutionary opportunity.",1614822684.0

At 12:00PM EST The borrowing cost rate on GME slightly dropped and AMC has moved UP  vs. my last report (Monday 3/1).

GAMESTOP CORP. -2.914%/APR

AMC ENTERTAINMENT -4.661%/APR

While these rates are slightly different than my prior reported rates and much lower than >20% APR rates a few weeks ago, any marked-up rates from  'general collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to some extent. Note this AM there was no problem borrowing GME but NO borrow available of AMC shares at these rates. Throughout last week mid-day, there were either no shares to borrow of these two securities or required a call to  my account rep, meaning shares were available earlier in AM but may be  fully committed at that point in the day.

I picture a literal Game-Stop, a place where people stop the grind of life and come and game together. Online gaming is great but I still think us apes need to leave our trees sometimes to jump and swing together in actual person.

- What if Game Stop hosted game night for groups of people and if D&D is too complicated, staff would teach players how to play the game?

- What about PC and console games being released before market sale to play only at Game Stop ""arcades"" where only prerelease games are available to be played before becoming available for the home, like movies at a theater before being released on video?

- Or small scale hosting of ""deck games"" where people can get together and play together or have tournaments? 

- Hey waiter, I'll have a burger and drink please; players ordering food that is brought directly to their gaming table!

Hey apes let's come together and play games in style only at Gamestop!!!

https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today

To the moon we go 🚀🚀🚀

PREVIOUS DD:

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌

9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

14618,Warning to new retards when day trading on margin,lwxx88,"This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other ~~new investors~~ retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me.

**This is not investment advice**, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a ""day trade"". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.

Pattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who ""day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period"", and a day trade is classified as ""the opening and closing of securities on the same day"". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.

For example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:

- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.

when read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.

I'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.

I have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.

Last thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.

As for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice). Good luck, and godspeed, fellow artists.",1614817715.0

Short interest: Apes learning to squeeze has been the greatest revelation since the discovery of FYRE by Billy McFarland. I will keep this one short. 47.25% short to be exact (relative to float). 2nd most shorted stock after our first true love $GME. Pretty squeezable if you ask me.

And for all you GME Tards out there downvoting this... MELVIN CAPITAL IS BETTING AGAINST THIS STOCK. HERE ARE THE PUTS THEY OWN
https://fintel.io/so/us/skt/melvin-capital-management-lp

Small market cap: As of today this company is worth 1.52 billion. $RKT Market Cap moved from approximately $40bn to $80bn in two days this week, and arguably has more upside to go. If $SKT market cap were to increase the same amount, it’s a 27x BAGGER!!!!! This stock can LITERALLY go to $400+ based on previous experience alone, AND there’s much higher SI. 

Building Awareness: I set myself up for $RKT and $GME by getting in ahead of the general curve. I am 2/2 on meme stocks so far, and this sweet sweet baby is sitting right in our wheelhouse. I watched as it started to shudder AH yesterday… and I knew it was time to bust out the vaseline but my wife’s boyfriend already used it all. 

Common sense: Does anybody really think shopping centres are going to be a thing of the past?? If I’m spending my tendies to buy clothes I’m sure as hell going to try them on. Sentiment is changing FAST. All lagging stocks have finally started booming, Texas dropped restrictions, $SKT go BOOOM 🚀

Open Interest: the call to put ratio is looking TASTY as of late. Lots of new calls being opened, and puts are down.

The name: I predict Lil’ Jon will be the number one artist of 2021 when this mafucka leaves the stratosphere. Worth a buy just for the memes

Misc info for your reading pleasure: 

* Quarterly Dividend of 4.33% implies health and balance sheet strength. Also free tendies.
* Price action steadily climbing since March 2020 crash. SUPER healthy chart movement over 1yr. Can’t believe it’s even shorted right now tbh, those HF’s must already be lighting money on fyre. 
* Brick and mortar isn’t going anywhere
* Some guy on here said he drove by a mall and the parking lot was full

TL;DR this is the next $RKT but…. dare I say better? 

Resume and disclaimer:

I hit 732.67% gains on $RKT calls bought this week. I sold at $33 like a PAB but got in way ahead of the curve. 

$SKT Positions:
4/16 20c 
4/16 25c

And fuck it. If this hits $250 WSB can vote on my tattoo.

Welcome to the next. Big. SHORT. AWWWWW $SKT $SKT MAFUCKAS 🚀

LULU - I've never seen this so oversold. Have you stopped seeing girls with great asses in tight yoga pants? Has every sorority girl, Becky and Soccer mom stopped wearing these because the pandemic is over? Are their stores reopening as the virus is contained? March 24th ER and should have a good run up with a pop after a big beat.

AAPL - No brainer here. Selloff on ER for no reason has been pinned down since. This is one of the best buy and holds at this price.

**Business Profile**

UWM Holdings Corporation engages in the residential mortgage lending business in the United States. The company originates mortgage loans through wholesale channel. It originates, processes, and underwrites primarily government-sponsored enterprises-conforming mortgage loans; and the Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Veteran Affairs mortgage loans, which are pooled and sold in the secondary market. The company was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan.

To start with, UWMC's EPS has gone down and is negative according to marketwatch, not sure how updated this is but it isnt a good thing to say the least:

* **-$0.09**

This isn't a good sign, but this won't matter if their is a squeeze. According to 4 analysts UWM Holdings is forecast to have 4.8% annual earnings growth and have 9.8% per year revenue growth which are both slower than the US Market's similar numbers. Meanwhile, UWMC's net profit margins are 59.7% which is higher than in 2020: 30%. Another good sign is UWMC earnings growth from this year: 545% which is higher than the Mortgage industry average of: 7%.

**Last Time It Did This It Just Tanked After???:** A lot of people think the that the price will dip the similar to what happened before on this stock, I believe while this is certainly possible, the difference this time is that UWMC introduced a dividend which the shorts will have to pay, making it more probable that the shorts will end up covering like they did for RKT (because of the dividend)

Does no one remember what happened the week after RobinHood banned buying of GME? Seriously. There was this mass belief among those of us long on GME (and I should know, I believed in it) that SO LONG as the ticker closed above $320 on Friday, we would wake up Monday morning to the squeeze of all short squeezes.


And Monday morning in pre-market and all during the day we look at the stock, and lo and behold, the MOASS happened, and every single person who ever bought GME sold it for a price greater than $1000, and world peace was realized because the wealth had been redistributed through the markets for the first time in history.


No. It began the fall down to $40, which it finally hit towards the end of the month. Sure, it’s back above $100 per share, but that date was wrong and dangerous and a lot of people lost a lot of money.


Look, I’m long on GME. I believe there’s a possibility of a short squeeze. But the cultier the message becomes, the more ANGRY people are that other tickers are mentioned:


>RKT is just a hedge fund attempt to distract people from GME, just like SLV was.


That’s a great point, buddy. Say, have you looked at their charts? Do you understand the fundamental difference between the mortgage industry and a ticker that purports to be backed by actual silver but isn’t?


Oh, and let’s talk about the gross overestimation of WSB’s power. It is literally impossible for this subreddit to P*mp and D*mp. Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it’s because they’re riding that train, not conducting it. No P*mp and D*mps are baked into the rules. Do you not trust u/zjz? What’s wrong with you. The market cap on tickers mentioned here has to be above a certain number to explicitly prevent p*mping and d*mping.
Don’t believe me?


Why isn’t PLTR at 50 then? No, seriously, why has it never hit $50 per share. They had a great earning last week. All over the subreddit people said it would hit $50.


In fact, if WSB is so damn important and powerful, how come GME spent almost an entire month below $60 per share in February?


Today could be a very good day. It could also be a very bad day- for whatever tickers you are invested in.


There are lots of great reasons to be long in GME outside of a potential short squeeze, and I personally think the stock is undervalued until it reaches a price of close to $200 per share, but I also think it will be incredibly volatile before that.


I also think it won’t earn that price target organically for two to three years. I think Ryan Cohen can successfully transform the company, and that’s why I’m long on GME.


So, rather than convincing yourselves that you know everything, that it’s all going to work out in a specific way at a certain date because of THIS INFORMATION, why don’t you relish in the fact that you don’t know. Because I certainly don’t. I don’t know anything. I’m a fucking idiot who makes financial decisions based off of gut feelings and the things I’ve read on a subreddit filled with other idiots. And that’s beautiful all on it’s own.",1614807260.0

The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  

I only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  

I don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  

Why I feel I need to post today:  
The mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.

I've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.

I've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). 

What conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  

I love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.

Good luck today everyone, and thank you.",1614805115.0

14814,"Choosing between $GME & $AMC, Let's gooooooooo $AMC to the fucking moon! 🚀🚀🚀",lwsqg7,"Listen Swamp Fox here, I found this chicken coup that's not guarded by any dogs. Coast is clear for now, you better eat as much chickens and eggs as possible. Cuz the dogs and bears are coming for our gains and chickens. $AMC is safe to go to the moon for a few days but will taper off next week. Saddle the fuck up, stay the fuck away from $GME unless you have balls of steel and trying to catch an aneurysm. But if you time it well, you might drive a new car. But I can't assure you. I will say, today's pop of $GME was a change of CFO in the company, showing they are serious about their management. So, it might be a legit company but the sugar rush can get you killed.
I'm not too greedy, so Imma stick with the smaller chicken, $AMC does have a solid balance sheet and very low debt. Soon to be acquired. I think there may be three pops.


1. Riding the $GME meme stock wave, but tapers cuz Wallstreet gonna bitch a little and Robinhood might do their fuckery. 

2. The second pop gonna piggyback on the news for opening 13 theaters in the east coast in March. I think it might taper off due to mix reactions of the theaters opening.

3. The third one I think it's gonna be related to being acquired cuz I think the players will see the potential in $AMC to integrate it into their existing streaming service.

 If I were in the mind of any company let's say Amazon or Netflix who are currently in talks on acquiring the mega cinema movie chain.
 
This would be the perfect opportunity to recoup lost revenue from 2020 COVID pandemic shutdown,bit will bolster their revenue by expanding the existing A-Lister program from $AMC to either companies existing streaming service subscriptions. And I would provide discount deals to like 20% off to combine the streaming service and enjoying the new ticket movie reservation experience at the theaters.

Somewhat similar to what HBO max is doing, but there's a possibility that the streaming service titans will now have a new jar that they can stick they hands in, the movies theater and distribution industry. Because if they own the movies, they now can receive their cut from movie distribution like Disney who hold their properties close to the chest to play their movies on the newly owned theaters. Some movies that either streaming service owns rights to, they'll have the more affordable plans without the theater plan if that customer isn't comfortable to go to the theaters or even prefer the comfort of their home. How ever it goes, it's going to be a solid win for either Amazon or Netflix.

That's just an opinion and an idea of mine. I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own research. I'm just a Fox who loves fucking shit up in the Swamp and help other to eat some too if they're silly as I am.

14832,HISTORICALLY MAPPING GME WITH ART - Project,lwsa2w,"This Isn’t a shit post mods. 

Current holdings on GME - 5@116.xx (buying more once holds clear) 

The reason for this post is because I’m currently developing a series of portraits of the highest bag holders on WSB. (As well as key imagery pertaining to the moment of time were living in)

Who’s to say what could happen in the next couple months. I feel it would be a great loss to humanity if we weren’t keeping a personal and conceptual record on whats happening in our current situation.  

I also thought it would be fun to paint future owners of the company and have them hang diamond hands in the board rooms at GME (long stretch)

The most important part for me to take out of this is record such a valuable historic event that ppl would be talking about for the next decades to come. Im not trying to profit off this i just want to create art. 

Maybe some of yeah can discuss about this?

( disclaimer: i am not fundraising, advertising, self promoting. Im raising a important topic which no one is talking about on this board. ) 

Tldr Im making art on the movement and want to accumulate more. 

(Please discuss pertaining to my post. Bots will be exposed.)

14888,PLTR - Newbie Play,lwqbmb,"TLDR: PLTR June 18th 2021 C, 30 strike price.

Firstly thanks for the free tendies @  u/The_Big_Short_2020  50 usd to 1500 usd in three days (screenshot can be attached to post as proof if needed) has been a great ride, and will be executing the 26.50 call options friday into shares (most likely, will update if I dont).

Now that I got a taste for making money, instead of lurking wsb for the last months and loosing money, I decided to post my plays here and here if the first rtard play.

Based on everything Ive seen recently about PLTR (and holding shares for the past 2 months). I decided to get in PLTR call options. Honestly, I have no idea whats PLTR planning in the next coming month, they have some great new partnerships and some awesome (long-term) projects in the pipeline. I have been seeing alot of great DD on PLTR in the sub and others. Other DD suggests that the market cap is way too high for the revenue they are generating. I believe that fundamentals are not the biggest factor anymore, now that all of us got our stim checks, and are yoloing money at shares that never had great fundamentals. True, PLTR may be overvalued, but name a silicon valley company that is not? Furthermore, PLTR is a company that actually has value.  


The play:

Right now the options are going for cheap. The share price has sunk down, after GME gang started loosing money and wsb went quiet. However, we are seeing bullish trends in the entire market, and specifically on the shares this sub is interested in.  
Around Feb 1 the stock was trading at 31 usd and then continued to YTD High of 38 usd on Feb 9th, just lagging behind GME's ATH.   
I suspect that with the new RKT and GME gang making money, they are gonna be just as retarded as me and gonna slowly start cashing out and be just as greedy to find the next play. Unfortunately there is a lack of DD posts and GME and RKT are now flooding wsb, but there has been a steady stream of wsbers buying Palantir stock and call options.

Im buying the call options at 30.00 expiring june 18th 2021, if they are even slightly in the money, I will execute the options. In the big change I am wrong and full of shit, the loss will be minimal.  I am not yoloing my NW but just looking to make some extra.

14910,eToro’s SL on GME,lwpcje,"Hello fellow hodlers, I need your help. Remember when eToro imposed SL at -25% after buying GME shares, even if it wasn’t with leverage? On the next day the eToro assistance wrote that they were going to refund traders who got their positions triggered by these SL.
Now: since I knew for sure that the stock would have plummeted for more than 25% (and fuck it did a lot more than that), and eToro assistance didn’t say a word about the SL-sh*t, I decided to close my positions at around -12/-15%, losing half of the losses I would have had only a couple hours later.
After the assistance’s announcement of the refund, I immediately contacted them, explaining my situation, and only yesterday, after a couple weeks of wait, they told me that ‘I managed to edit my SL, so they cannot refund me in any way’. 
...
WTF does that mean? Considering I didn’t edit any SL, nor I wanted to put any, and considering that they weren’t leveraged position, am I missing something? Are they right here, or should I go on, maybe with a lawsuit or something? (I put a lot of money in it, so it is worth for me to do so). 
Are there any ‘lawyers’ or apes expert in these kind of sh*t who can help me clear my mind?

Why did we not get transparency about how gæmstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?

First, the thread wasn't made.

Then the threads made by users were being manually deleted.

Then we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of ""no more gæmstonk daily threads, more news later.""

That comment got deleted.

Then we're told ""it's because interest in gæmstonk has died down"" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)

Then RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off gæmstonk pushers.

Then we get told that the mods simply ""forgot"" to make the gæmstonk thread.

Then finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.

...

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?

You don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.

I haven't seen ANY good DD on gæmstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*

That precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.

As a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN gæmstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.

I am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.

Movement is best THIS WEEK.

Nobody knows it... because all the front page gæmstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. 

I don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.

Edit: there is a mod reply, please don't downvote it.

Edit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.

Edit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment.",1614788881.0

Im here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. 
Lets start with the bad. 

In 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. 

It has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. 
When the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.

Many big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. 

Honestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. 
The good.
Its absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times ""he loves burning shorts"".
Last week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. 
The market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. 
Its efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. 
Today the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.
They have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.
Institutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.

B.riley eoy price target : 398. 
I think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.
The news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too. But if any of the squeezes your in do their thang, and nvax is still down, double check to make sure nothing bad happened with the stock and then bring those tendies over for more tendies!!!",1614775598.0

15047,Information and DDs on WSB,lwkhrb,"Hello all,

This is discussion is to just bring awareness to some issues that have been occurring on the subreddit. I'm going to try to avoid bringing my own opinion into this as that doesn't matter. With the millions of new members that have recently joined, there has been a lot of known and unknown misinformation and I've really noticed that it's primarily been in the comments section. 

Now I know the spotlight has been on GME for the past 3ish months but you all really have to remember that this is NOT a GME subreddit. It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content.

**INFO**

There has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content. Now I have no idea whether this is true or not, however, please do not go spreading info around if you are not informed. There have also been posts and comments about ""tactics that short-sellers"" use to manipulate the stock  (that I'm not going to name), which aren't even real tactics. Please, don't just take posts or comments about certain info with a ""grain"" of salt or even a ""pinch"". Take the info you see with a **fist full of salt**. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!! PLEASE!

**""\_\_\_\_ is a distraction from \_\_\_\_\_""**

(this section is where I am mostly biased on) Please. Not everything is a distraction from GME or whatever is the hottest play on WSB. There are literally thousands of other stocks that can be bought or sold. I've seen some people say that they are suspicious of RKT because it came ""out of nowhere"" when there have been dozens of DDs since the stock came onto the market. I've seen comments like ""nIcE tRY heDGieS""....okay right manipulate and trick retail traders to trade over 350M+ shares of RKT so we forget about the past 3 months of GME? Trust me, when you open this subreddit, you almost only see GME. There is no need to remind everyone of the GME short-squeeze. 

**""Where do you get these plays from?""**

You can filter the spam and the memes by filtering by DD mode from the daily thread. There are some AMAZING DDs on this sub, you just have to look for them. Remember to do your own research. DDs should not be your only source of info and make sure the DD has some links to their sources or you can ask the OP. You should primarily look at DDs as simply bring awareness to a company for you to look at, and after further research, you can then decide.

If you want to change focus create another subreddit with the other stonks or things, is crucial and very important to stay connected, stay with the eyes in the ball and motivated moving towards one direction. GME is the direction.

I’ve also noticed there are a lot of people fearing and a lot of shillas out there, don’t worry about it! Stay true with the reason why we are here and keep the focus! It’s gonna happen soon and it’s gonna happen if we stay together and strong!

Here to talk about a company with alot of potential that isn’t GME or RKT. I know, I know, sad and im retarded and should just buy those stocks

Lordstown motors is IMO a heavily overlooked and undervalued EV stock that has not had its fair chance to flourish yet. 

-They will be the first electric pickup truck to market -They have a 600 acre factory right here in the USA
- A partnership with Camping world ( I know lame but distribution= 🚀 )
-100k preorders
-45k price tag on the pickup after government incentives (52k without)
-Backing by GM
 
All with only a 3.4B market cap. 
If only half of the none binding preorders got filled(which is unlikely because the average order size is 600 and you need to set up charging stations for all those trucks at there destinations and that takes time and planning) that would be 2.6B in revenue. Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven. 


Analyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.

They are also now reprinting old articles of a very early “skateboard”(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.

Another fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.

Steve Burns the CEO has entered the Lordstown Endurance into a 290 mile Baja race in Mexico to prove the concept. 

The race is in April, Earnings are next week, the moon this year. 

This isnt investment advice, I am clearly retarded and I wrote this all while I was licking the windows on the short bus

I posted this AM ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt\_ddtendies\_part\_2\_decent\_amount\_of\_squeeze\_left/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt_ddtendies_part_2_decent_amount_of_squeeze_left/)) regarding more squeezing when the price was $28.  I thought it would trade sideways and then a crazy afterhours.  Seems the covering occurred early for an explosive afternoon.  I believe the stock will still squeeze more, even to triple digits, as all the ITM call options get exercised this Friday.  **Additionally, there are 03/19 call options up to $50, which mean additional gamma squeeze from options still exists**.  

Interestingly, the despite the short covering, **shorts have increased bringing the total up to 46% or 46% float (data from S3:** [**https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801**](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801)**).**  

**All Catalyst events:**

1) Blowout earnings, and excellent forecast to be successful even when, eventually the interest rates go up.  Remember at the end of the day this is a **profitable** company.

2) Special dividend of 1.11 on 03/08/20.  Other than bleeding the shorts for this dividend, people may recall their shares back to get this true dividend.

3) Increased publicity tomorrow  [https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx) 

4) Large institutional ownership and unlikely that the majority shareholders will sell at this point.  They want to trigger a squeeze

5) Rising short interest with a 50% borrowing fee.  There were no shares left to borrow by 11 am and that's why the stock quickly 'rocketed up'.  Currently there are only 15000 shares left to borrow at this time (and none for the few hours after market close) and they will probably be borrowed first thing AM.

6) I have heard more OTM options may be written by the end of this week.

Given the huge runup this week, I'm much more conservative and suggest buying shares or ITM debit spreads, but for the more cavalier of you can buy some OTM 03/19 or, if they make new options this week, some OTM 03/05 options.

15091,A word of caution about what’s to come,lwjcgf,"Before you take my order of french fries and a large frosty I wanted to tell you a story... 

I’m a long time lurker in the WSB and I have been following the GME saga since December, unfortunately I jumped in too late so I bought 4 shares at 350 on Jan 28th and I have been holding them with my life, also I kept buying more to average down.

I have the same mentally as most of people here… **I believe in the company and all the changes it’s doing so, I do believe that even if the SS doesn’t happen having GME stock is an amazing investment.** 

But fear not, there is enough evidence to know that **it’s not a matter of “if the SS happens or not, is just a matter of WHEN it’s going to happen”**

ANYWAYS… what I wanted to say is, **when the MOASS happens you need to be prepared, specially, mentally prepared for the ultra bumpy ride.** 

I have the feeling that everyone here thinks that once the rocket takes off everything is going to be a smooth ride and you just need to wait for the perfect time to sell and become rich… I have bad news for you, it won’t be like that.

If you think that this last weeks between HFs hiding information, media publishing shitty articles about why you shouldn’t invest in GME, a bald dude on T.V. talking crap about the stock or Reddit, all the short ladder attacks, bots, shills, lying to the Congress…etc… is crazy, just wait until this thing explodes.

**I presume most of us, or probably all of us, have seen a movie where a space ship goes through an asteroid belt?  That’s going to be our rocket, that’s going to be this forum and it’s going to be pandemonium.**

I do believe and admire the collective wisdom (this is the reason why all the DDs we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes, for what it matters is the same).

However, I do also believe in mass panic, and panic and fear are really strong emotions.

Every single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time **logic, intelligence and incredible well done DDs are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control**. (Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)

Greed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40’s range.

In this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. 

Don’t forget **it’s not the same a HF having a “civilized” fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000…5,000….10,000.**

**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**

So, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. 

And I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.

However, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... 

 **tl;dr:** **DON’T PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**

$ON    Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for    various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in    automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances.

""Other    manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor    shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars,  whether   they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions  for  every  manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That  means  assembly   line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines  and  shop   equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and   microwave. It  even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending   it all after  you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the   toaster, which uses a   power switch, which are made by $ON. ""

They create [new electronic parts](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210217005026/en/ON-Semiconductor-Announces-New-650V-Silicon-Carbide-MOSFETs) for the market as often as I dream of making tendies.

Even innovating new technology. [World’s First Automotive Qualified SiPM Array Product for LiDAR Applications](https://www.eejournal.com/industry_news/on-semiconductor-launches-worlds-first-automotive-qualified-sipm-array-product-for-lidar-applications/).

[The    semiconductor industry is expected to grow every year exponentially    with the pent-up demand that will continue for years to come.](https://www.google.com/search?q=stonks+meme&client=firefox-b-d&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=u6efoi5-iFSDLM%252C1tK3bZ4IdEGK9M%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kQYuA_T6I_Oov2SaTU3RYEhCMrFog&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwio-I3F6pLvAhV5ITQIHUWCD2gQ9QF6BAgOEAE&biw=1920&bih=1098#imgrc=u6efoi5-iFSDLM)

A    new CEO was brought in with tremendous experience in the  semiconductor   industry (sound familiar?) that has experience growing  both revenues  and  margins at Cypress Semiconductors. **Hassane El-Khoury**; the man, the myth, a new tendie legend. Already a moving force in the semiconductor world, [he    was a pointing factor behind the merger of Infineon Technologies and    Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the  organisation](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/company/cypress-acquisition/) as ""one of the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers"".

I'm    a grower and not a show-er, so if you want growth you can actually   hear  it from me personally. This company is a killer for revenue   because  they are financially stable and very profitable as is this   play.

""The    one thing that sets   $ON apart from the rest of the equities on  this    list is that  they're  not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not  a    company that  simply  outsources chip production to other people     (overseas) and  who has  shown a willingness to keep some production in     house.   Matter of  fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that  he     wants to  maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.   Which     means  when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer  money   to    build out US production, they'll have their hands out.""

# USA's BBC (BIG BIDENS COMMAND)

Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-to-sign-executive-order-tied-to-semiconductor-shortage-11614177715)last week for “an immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to    address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products.   Those  four products are semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical   minerals  such as rare earths, and large-capacity batteries such as   those used in  electric vehicles"". **As well as the by-product of tendies.**

[Military Possibilities:](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/biden-to-order-supply-chain-review-to-assess-us-reliance-on-overseas-semiconductors.html)The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and    supply chains that are dominated by or run through “nations that are or    are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.”

Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent  of their chip makers.

# Throw your PT out the window its already hitting the moon

[Bank of America (BofA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bofa-double-upgrading-semiconductor-180553211.html)raises price target from $32 to $48. “We are late to recognizing ON’s    turnaround potential, but we still see potential for another 20%+  stock   upside as management makes the case for turnaround at their  upcoming   Aug. 5 analyst day"". ON top of the PT double upgrade!

# VERY BULLISH FOR SHORT AND LONG PLAY

Set your calendar dates to 100 days after the BBC $ON June 7, 2021.

Under priced options with low IV but why is there so much O/I? The market is bullish for this stock that's why.

$ON is a fierce competitor with an extremely experienced and competent CEO who already predicts when their [backlog](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/on-semiconductor-ceo-expects-auto-chip-backlog-to-end-by-third-quarter.html)   will end. Get in while you can for a short and long term   investment/play. An only opportunity to get options and stock while its   cheap.

&#x200B;

# You want green, I want green, we all get green

""Additionally, $ON products find their ways into **vehicle charging** and **battery technology** which is also a growing area. Global drive for **power efficiency** will also increase in the face of the ""Green Deal"" and increasing global drive for **CO2 reduction**.""

&#x200B;

# Did someone say short squeeze?

This    is not a short squeeze play, but if you hate shorts and know how to    squeeze a tiny one like I do my own, then jump on it for an [8% shares short ratio](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=ON) squeeze.

15131,How to find the Next thing (foreal),lwig5b,"**Step 1:** switch that ""hot"" button to sort by ""new""

**Step 2:** ignore all things that say GME,  or RKT, or whatever the next big thing is at that time

**step 3:** look at all other tickers, if they are related to GME or RKT rather then just dd in any way (mortgage company like rkt, heavily shorted for gme) ignore it they're likely just after the hype caused by the rush.

**Step 4**: You've found a stock, coo, now look at its financials what's its share holders equity what's its net income? what's its market value? and how much do you weigh each of these? that's a personal thing, a lot of people have taken the stance that fundamentals are useless now siting TSLA and the like but that's still the easiest way to sort through the shit if you ask me.

**Step 5:** look for news, what's the sentiment? what are the aims its going for and when is this going to be revealed? you want something that has a clear way to burst through the market OTHER THEN EARNINGS, earnings are nice but it needs a clear cut reason it should go off. RKT's PE ratio was insanely good for its sector and what it was making giving it a clear cut above the rest.

**Step 6:** buy in with a A PORTION of your money into a call/put/stock based on your own taste. the more your in the market, the more you'll understand what your looking for better. i personally like to aim for previous lows within a bullish run.

**Step 7: Profit? lmao probably not**, i said to use a portion cause everything i said can help give you a better shot but lets be real here, **your using a sub who calls each other autists and retards, that recently got swamped with people who have no real stock knowledge,  when we were already struggling in the knowledge department before hand lmao. GL, your fucked either way**

Edit: A lot of people are putting ""I followed this and found xxx stock"" and let me tell you i hate most of their financials, JS, yall got some shitty understandings of step 4-5.

I can agree with most people that RKT may have been under valued due to the recent dividend ; but **is RKT the next GME stock? In my opinion NO.** The key difference to GME is the short position. Chairmen Daniel Gilbert alone at RKT owns [1.9 billion shares](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/743306605445251126/816453893160173568/unknown.png) ( [1.9billion 2nd link)](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/insider-activity) while the total available shares is only [115 million](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/institutional-holdings). If you have been following any of the GME DD **the short position on RKT is no where near GME short shorts  (Please some one prove me wrong).**

The only concern I see with RKT is the [option chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RKT/options?p=RKT) for this week and next week ; it's all closing in the money. What does this mean? I'm not sure exactly. But looking at the chain for march 5th I can tell you Puts are currently short roughly -119 million dollars. So every dollar past $34 is just a win for anyone holding common stock. I'm really just interested what other people have to say about entire option chains expire in the money. Any one see this before?

We are all apes we can eat different bananas; I'm just want to debate bananas

Edit 1: Shorted Shares DD

As of 3/2/20 The market cap for RKT currently sits at [82.55 billion](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RKT:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwis0vHo-ZLvAhWUVc0KHcenDr4Q3ecFMAB6BAgQEBo&window=MAX) which is roughly 1,984,375,000 shares at 41.60.

Common stock (that anyone can buy) sits at 155million. So yes ill heed everyone that RKT has been shorted at least 24% or -37,802,661 shares.

Before I get started, can you morons who are shitting all over $RKT buyers shut up? WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you they bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.

Now, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the\_industry\_players\_again\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/)

(Credit to u/Dadri88 and u/skifunkster)

But what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes. Here's why:

$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.

Why is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.

Imagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.

If it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.

So, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!

15202,AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains,lwh4b3,"# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]

AMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.

Now over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \[steadily\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.

Early last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.

So to sum up why it was low last year.

&#x200B;

* Streaming services being used more
* Cinemas closed due to Covid.
* No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]
* Bankruptcy possibility
* Free reign hedge fund short selling
* No one buying the stock

# Now this year is different

We all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.

# Overvalued or Undervalued?

For the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.

&#x200B;

* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.
* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.
* ~~No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.
* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.
* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \[if not most\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.
* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.

Now I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.

# Now Lets Talk About March

&#x200B;

* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.

[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)

&#x200B;

* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares

[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)

&#x200B;

# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.

A lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.

&#x200B;

* March 5th \[this Friday\] theaters will reopen in NY \[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)

&#x200B;

* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \[my belief it is\] this will drive the price up farther.

https://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e7d0fd12cedcab1659dbd3dc1ca69210adad2d

* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)

Not only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)

*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*

&#x200B;

* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.

&#x200B;

* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \[March 5th\] to Short interest report \[March 9th\] and Earning report \[March 10th after hours into 11th\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

🚨🚨MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS 🚨🚨, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. 🚨🚨

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the 💎👐 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this 🚀. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

🚨🚨MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 🚨🚨

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, 🚀 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

🚨🚨My PT is $73.5. 🚨🚨

🚨🚨50 TOMORROW 🚨🚨

🚨🚨60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.🚨🚨

THIS IS NOT A 🧻👐TRADE

Don’t be idiots we are literally sabotaging ourselves by downvoting juicy plays. GME is definitely about to rocket soon tho theres only like 85k shorts to borrow.

It’s been a long time since most have u diamond hands have seen green too take a breather collect yourselves and come back harder. Drip or drown baby

15248,Rocket Prediction,lwgcmw,"This is not financial advise. 

First semi real post here so bare with me. I’ve noticed a trend between the last few days and the GameStop saga. I’m not sure if it will play out the same way but from my (recent) memory some of this set up seems familiar. 

1. Trade volume. Looked back at GameStop the two days prior to moon day (1/28), there was significantly higher volume. Today we saw even higher volume all within a single day. Not sure if there is any correlation but the lead up volumes seem to be similar. 
2. Broader market. I haven’t checked every ticket but I did notice that everything I’m tracking and a few other I spot checked were all down today. If memory serves correct, everything was down the day before  1/28
3. Hype. I never really saw what happened with that weed stock that gained momentum a week or two ago (I took a little time off after GME), but it seemed like it came and went before I noticed. Don’t remember the ticker so haven’t checked, but it had to be something like 3-4 days. Tomorrow is day 3 of hype

Not financial advise, but just a heads up with some anecdotal memories. Tomorrow may be the day.

15249,GME PLEASE READ,lwgbtr,"Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month.

**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)

EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO

**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**...

**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**

Here is why my fellow tards,

1. **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote ""**Lackluster day**"" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!
2. **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **""GAMMA SQUEEZE"" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.**
3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.

**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)**

4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.

5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:**

\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.

\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.

this shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**

&#x200B;

\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.**

**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a ""NEW SQUEEZE RKT"" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**

TL;DR Rocket Labs is actually going to the moon, confirmed. [I shit you not.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/)

If you didn’t read into the news, company deck and analysis out there, here is the important shit.

**TAM**

* Forecasted to be 1.4T in 2030
* Space is the next frontier, unforeseen TAM expansion

I know your smooth brains can't even predict where you'll wake up tomorrow morning, but this is like trying to forecast how big the internet was going to be in Stanford's basement.

**Backers**

* Solid names like Lockeed and Blackrock. When you say Blackrock and Rocket in the same sentence, you know it's game over
* Auntie Cathie is probably eye balling this company hard, probably trying to come up with excuses on why it should be added to each ETF
* SpaceX only allowed 69 investors in for the last raise, people are hungry to throw money at it. The line to get in is longer than the unemployment line. Where do you go when you can't get in?

**Revenue growth**

* Easily beat 2021 forecast, already 90% booked, this is straight out of their pitch deck. Yes, companies lie, but go look at [this man's face](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/), would he lie to you?
* Government (not just US) space spending will increasing YoY. Biden wants to leave a mark, and not the kind of shit on the backwall of his toilet bowl.
* Space Startups increasing YoY, and everyone needs a ride to orbit. This is like 2 am when the club closes, everyone wants an Uber but there ain't enough drivers. RL's launches are already booked out.
* Satellites as a service is a new business model, making it accessible for a lot more companies, already picking up traction. Ryan Cohen with his own GME satellites? Hell, this sub can probably pool together for WBS satellite.

**CEO**

* Does actual rocket engineering like Elon, you don't want some bean counter.
* Guy is a genius, multiple records and awards, [he has actually sat on a rocket and set a land speed record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-29/at-18-he-strapped-a-rocket-engine-to-his-bike-now-he-s-taking-on-spacex)
* Elon has is a busy man, he's looking after 4 different companies. This is Peter's only focus.
* Let's be honest, better accent, and bigger belly. This is good.

**Moat**

* Vertically integrated entire Rocket and Satellite manufacturing process. They make their own shit.
* Already becoming a supplier for component ingredients. They supply people their shit.
* Patents build up of 3D printed rocket engine designs, battery integration, etc. Had me at 3D printing.
* Private, government back launch sites dedicated to RL. This is the new hot real estate.

**Brand**

* Proven track record. They've launched 97 Rockets to date, this is more than 69 for those of you that can't count.
* Multiple government contracts, NASA level shit
* Elon tweets @ em, we all know what Elon's tweets can do
* Their logo is a 🚀

**Competition**

* Only 2 companies consistently making it to orbit: SpaceX and RL
* SpaceX dead set focused on Mars colony with Starship, (retired F1, likely F9). RL will happily take that piece of the pie. RL is going to the Moon [and Venus](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html). To me, we're are going to another fuckin planet, don't care which one.
* Everyone else either is showing no results, and/or struggling with failures, delays and change in management. Rockets are hard, who knew, even Bezos' Blue Origin is laggin.

**Short term catalysts**

* Moon mission is going to going to make waves, but I don't need to tell you that.
* ARK will add, just a question of for how many ETFs.
* Look, they can do up to 120 launches a year, the viewership for these launches are trending up, the only different is, there will now be a stock ticker watermarked to screen. This is GME billboards on steroids.",1614756173.0

When I saw the GME trade last month, I believe I saw it the same way that many WSB outsiders saw it: a new era in trading. 

I instantly joined your forum and was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence carefully concealed under the constant barrage of circle jerking, banana eating, tendie getting, cursing, and obscure references.... But I could read in between the lines, started paying attention, and thanks to some excellent DD by a few of you, I executed the best trade of my life on RKT today. That said.... There's still space. Here's why:

The dividend announcement should get everyone's attention. At $23-24, it was basically giving away 5% to shareholders. Big institutions will pile in for the free money. That run will probably continue through Friday.  This is the first dividend the company has announced.

RKT financials are actually BLOWING AWAY the industry. Check them out. This is not a company that MIGHT become profitable someday. This is the real deal on earnings. 

Share price has been historically suppressed since inception of the ticker. Check out the trading range for yourself. 

In comparison to trading multiples of competitors, they are trading at prices that are lower than normal. 

Finally, I believe we have huge momentum and attention from today's trading. Take a good look and do what you feel. 

Thanks guys for letting me play along. I wish my great grandfather, an old school New York banker, who grew up a poor black child in Bulgaria, could see this...

15315,The Truth about RKT...,lwf0md,"This is not financial advice and neither do you have to listen to my opinion. I’m just expressing myself...

With that being said, I honestly don’t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting? it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it’s worth investing in, maybe not.

I personally do not have a position in RKT and I won’t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I’m still -45% (it was -82% but I continued to average down) but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. 

Now back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn’t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would’ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. 

At the end, it’s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can’t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you’ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There’s no telling when it will end. But when it does it’ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.

Of course you do not have to listen to me. I don’t even know what I’m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for what I call the “Rocket Gamma Short Squeeze” 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: I do feel very conflicted with this post I made, and I might take it down. Is it a way to directly distract us (I.e, their manipulating RKT stock upwards)?  No. but are they indirectly manipulating the stock (I.e, through all of the media coverage and bots sharing gains on WSB and stuff)? I very much think this can be the case. If you ever see an increase in posts where people are praising RKT and shaming GME then that’s blatant manipulation... 
But I just cannot stand seeing my fellow apes acting like GME cultists, we mustn’t get too emotional and think everything has got to do with GME. I own some TILRAY stocks long term, and I also hold CCIV stocks long term and continue to dollar cost average down into profits. But when it comes to short term, I’m solely focused on GME and AMC and I own far more GME than any other stock currently because I really believe in this movement, plus my brain would malfunction if I has to look at more than two shares at once😅",1614754952.0

15339,Keep Your Eyes on the Volume Behind the Movement,lweje6,"**The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**

The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.

VWAPs can be treated as the ""true"" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a ""bounce"" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.

There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.

Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.

In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.

Happy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock

My theory is these new accounts, whether they be interns or shills/bots or what have you, are either working to farm karma so they come across as more credible when the actual shit starts going down again. Or, are trying to use a lot of terms like “what are WE doing?” “I thought WE were all focusing on GME?” In order to create evidence of market manipulation on a large scale on WSB.

15449,$GME DD - Let's talk about MARGIN,lwcu33,"For those of you who do not know what Margin is, let's just simplify it to ""borrowed money."" When you open an investment account with any broker, they give you the option to trade on margin. The amount of Margin they give you is based on your assets versus their calculated risk.

There are 2 key reasons trading GME (or any stock you like) on Margin are dangerous if your goal is to score some gains off of a potential squeeze:

1) Shares bought on Margin can be borrowed and shorted. Not just those shorting at the $5-20 level when this began, but also those being shorted right now at $130. Shares bought with Cash (your money) cannot be shorted if you make your account a cash account. This can effectively reduce the Float.

2) Shares bought on margin can be called in. We saw this happen with RH and other Brokers in January. The borrowed money was not worth the risk of loss for these firms, so they executed the right to call in your borrowed assets to cover their exposed risk.

TL;DR - If you're goal is to reduce the float available to shorts, DO NOT trade on Margin. Make your account a ""Cash"" account and trade with your own available cash to prevent your shares from being borrowed.

15573,What Triple (Quadruple) Witching Day March 19th GME/AMC,lwat9i,"-Triple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day. It happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Because three option classes expire all on the same day, it can cause increased trading volume and unusual price action in the underlying assets.

-Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.

-Triple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

-Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell—called the ""triple witching hour""—can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

-Triple witching days generate trading activity and volatility because contracts that are allowed to expire may necessitate the purchase or sale of the underlying security. While some derivative contracts are opened with the intention of buying or selling the underlying security, traders seeking derivative exposure only must close, roll out, or offset their open positions prior to the close of trading on triple witching days.

So this is what I get looking up why this is important, still learning stock terminology and significance of specialties like this one. Hadn’t really seen this talked about, just more so thrown out into the retardation of the echo chambers of multiple subs. 

Can someone with experience upon these specialty days within the stock market elaborate on what could be so important to happen upon this date?

15891,Hedgies are continuing to hide their shorts in ETFs,lw5rgz,"As you guys know, some shady stuff has been going on. This is from today showing how two bear ETFs went up 700%:

This is just one example of what they're doing to:

A) Hide shorts so that the public can't find the % shorted or any other information. This is highly misleading and is not aligned with the spirit of transparency we should expect.

B) Drive the price down on both AMC and GME to deceiving people into thinking that these stocks are perfectly stable and there isn't an imminent gamma squeeze.

C) Get people to bail out, and ultimately make people get bored and sell their stock. It's important to just buy and hold. The general trends for GME and AMC are almost identical - when one goes up, so does the other.

&#x200B;

Remember, every time you sell just to gain a few bucks, the hedgies are able to stretch the gamma, so there's less of a squeeze. If you want max gains and mad bananas plz hold and check back in 2069",1614730642.0

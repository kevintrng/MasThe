A quick look at price performance for 2021 EV companies vs a few of the old school.

Ford was the winner for the year (excl. Tesla, not included as it's focus seems to be away from cars)

SPACs, apart from $LCID, were loss makers.  

3 companies are claiming to start production in the next 12 months, and one in 2023.

Looking through the companies product portfolios, there will be a lot of competition for EV pickups in the next year or so - probably too many for the market to sustain as north America is the only major market by volume and market share.

&#x200B;

2021 car (excl pickups and light trucks) production estimated as 63m, down from 74.9m in 2019",1640893539.0

231,Corsair Gaming (CRSR): What's it worth? Deep-Dive Analysis,rs7x8y,"Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.

**Company Overview**

Founded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (“Corsair” or the “Company”) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.

With many of Corsair’s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.

Corsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.

**Financial Snapshot & Commentary**

https://preview.redd.it/ms0uur8zyp881.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=386658bb23dadf9e5415050bf5f70891965aa926

https://preview.redd.it/4e45ssa1zp881.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7d12d55ec46f1232489c307e83738187ed3318

*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*

Sales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.

**Q3 2021 Results**

* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021
* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components
* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%
* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC
* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products
* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps

**Preliminary Risks**

* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts
* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products
* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products
* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share
* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries

**DCF Valuation**

https://preview.redd.it/hjdj09e3zp881.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0460d39adfc6d85e4a4ccfbcd32417c7836cc9c1

*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*

*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*

Winter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%

* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.

**Public Comps Analysis**

Competitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.

Based on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31

**Outlook and Final Thoughts**

Based on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.

371,$HLTH: The Play You Want In For the Coming Weeks 🚀,rs3l2c,"**🚀The Thesis for Cue Health ($HLTH) 🚀:**

**Disclaimer: 📈📈📈 Short term bullish play (around 3-4 weeks for y’all WSB degens)**

**This is my first big write up so please be friendly and constructive with your comments :)**

As many of you all are aware, with what seems like the 100th strain of COVID— Omicron— spreading across the world, COVID-testing kits are once again in hot demand. I’m doing this write up to explain my bullish stance on COVID test kit suppliers going forward.

**Why Test Kits :**

* It is clear that we will have to co-exist with COVID, so shutting down our economy is not an option. Thus, mass-vaccination and testing have become the optimal strategies.
* Given vaccination rates have plateaued, nation-wide testing is the best thing we can do to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.

**Context:**

The Omicron variant, which now is the dominant (and most contagious) strain in the United States, has driven daily US COVID cases past the Delta variant’s peak. However, the United States severely lags behind European countries for COVID testing. In these countries, such test kits are ubiquitous, while there is a test kit shortage at US retailers. For instance, those in the US have to spend at least $14 for a two-pack at U.S retailers, compared with $5 or less in some countries, such as Germany (WSJ). The U.K government distributes free tests to its citizens on a weekly basis. While the countries’ differing healthcare systems contribute to this, it is undeniable that there exists a severe COVID testing shortage in the United States. In fact, President Biden admitted last week that “I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion \[tests\] two months ago, before Covid hit here.”

As such, there should be no doubt that the United States government will become more proactive in its acquisition of test kits, emulating the U.K and other European countries, which are giving out so many free kits so people can test themselves every week.

The Biden Administration recently announced the purchase of 500 million home kits. The contracts to purchase the tests have not been finalized, but even if we were to conservatively assume an average purchase price of $15, that is $7.5 billion going into the COVID test kit supplier market. To put that into perspective, the largest federal contracts that have been granted to COVID-test manufacturers are around $500-600 million with Celltrion and Abbott.

**🚀Bottomline🚀: Omicron is SPREADING FAST, and the lack of supply for test kits creates an asymmetric demand/supply relationship, with the government compounding the price inelasticity of demand. The few companies that are able to supply up-to-par test kits have strong pricing power.**

&#x200B;

[COVID cases in the past 2 years](https://preview.redd.it/9ludt4jjyo881.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35b068d85a84b3732276038d562cdaa4e621ff6)

**Overview of COVID Test Manufacturing Market:**

The market is pricing for a mild growth in the next two years yet underestimated the recent momentum. The testing trend is top-down and is only beginning to develop. First, the DoD or HHS will start granting generous contracts to vamp up manufacturing capacity; as Omicron continues to spread, businesses and organizations will purchase large quantities of tests for their employees to minimize disruption from the pandemic; massive and regular testing will become the norm: households and businesses will order tests in bulk orders on a regular basis.

**💎 Why Should I Invest In Cue Health ($HLTH) 💎 ?**

Out of the various COVID testing manufacturers, Cue Health ($HLTH) is one of the best out there with over $480 million in federal contracts as well as To-B contracts with Google, Mayo Clinic, the NBA, Canada Air etc. Rather than making antigen rapid tests, Cue developed the NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification) testing method. As of this moment, Cue is the only NAAT test manufacturer that has developed its own integrated platform solution and can manufacture in-house. Mayo Clinic conducted thorough research and concluded that Cue’s home testing kits results have a 98% match (vs. \~85% sensitivity for Antigen tests) with PCR Lab results.

TLDR: Cue’s testing method is revolutionary by producing testing results virtually identical to those conducted in a professional lab in under 20 minutes ❗️❗️

As a result of its superior testing capacity, Cue Health demands a high premium for its kits, which so far its clients (the federal government, premier healthcare providers, prestigious national sports leagues etc.) are willing to pay for. Aside from its top-notch caliber of clientele, Cue’s 60% GM and 10%+ NI business, along with their recent IPO, will inject them with enough cash to expand on their product offerings outside of Covid testing. This will in turn generate more cash to capitalize even more on their superior technology, creating an upward flywheel effect.

Moreover, it is very likely that Cue Health will be one of the beneficiaries (gain new federal contracts) under the recent initiatives from the Biden Administration. Its $481 mill contracts last year in October include both capex on new manufacturing facilities and $6 mill testing kits. The company sees its capex expand rapidly in that quarter from $4.8 million to $30.5 million in Q1FY21 and 27.1 million in Q2. Since Capex decreased to $19.3 million next quarter, we can reasonably estimate that total capex will be south of 100 mill, since the company will finish ramping up its manufacturing capacity within a year. This implies that each testing kit for Cue costs around $60 (way higher than the average Antigen kit). Given that their 12-month TTM revenue of $438.9 million and the majority of their revenue is, for now, federal contracts, it can be estimated that they’ve at least delivered 4 million testing kits as of today. It is very likely that they will gain a decent piece of the 500-million testing kits federal contract.

**🌑 The Bear Case🌑:**

South Africa’s decline in COVID cases may suggest that its Omicron peak has passed. It will be worth observing whether this decline occurs in the United States. If cases steadily decrease, this might prompt investors to believe that testing demand will start dying down once again, causing selling pressure.

**🌟 Mitigating Factors🌟:**

The Biden Administration, along with many influential people in the healthcare community have expressed their regrets over not escalating testing programs, reiterating that they will not repeat their mistake of distributing enough COVID to help combat potential surges. Furthermore, a vast majority of Cue’s clients will still require Cue’s products and services. The federal government and businesses will still need to test their employees on a regular basis; travelers will still need negative results to be cleared for cross-border traveling. Therefore, while the eventual dying-down of Omicron might affect market sentiment, its fundamentals remain robust as there will always be a huge need for rapid COVID testing.

**🔥Conclusion🔥:**

Going forwards, we will be seeing a fundamental shift in attitudes and business behaviors regarding COVID-testing in the United States. As Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories acknowledges that “we can’t be caught flat-footed again \[in regards to the severe shortage of testing\].” Any short-term concerns on whether testing demand would die down have now completely dissipated. This tailwind will certainly last well into 2022 and potentially further down the road as it is almost consensus now that we will co-exist with COVID.  As long as that is the case, Cue Health ($HLTH) will stand to be one of our largest winners 🚀 🚀 🚀 .

It started with the media trying to paint our community as [market manipulators](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1s932/cnbc_is_trying_so_hard_lmao/) or that it's [run by hedge funds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4hgrwmsyPo).  All these tactics were to smear and dismiss your presence was disgusting. Our [discord was even banned for ""hate speech""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pNfm7-CN-A)  which was a bullshit reason.  Brokerages even went as far as [restricting buying](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-interactive-brokers-restrict-trading-in-gamestop-s.html) on certain stocks which is completely unheard of.   It was interesting watching everything unfold as every attempt they used to change the rules or discredit you backfired every time, and only caused the situation to gain momentum into what some would describe as a ""Movement"".

Our community grew gained nearly 9 million new members by the end of the first month of the year.

756,$pltr founder makes racist comments,rrimv2,"The founder of Palantir, Joe Lonsdale, today publicly made controversial comments about Black entrepreneurs. Joe suggests that the low funding rate of Black Americans in corporate formation was due to the ills of ""black culture"" and ""having so many kids born out of wedlock"". Further Joe's claim is obviously not supported by data.  


Presently public sentiment has been swift with many venture capitalist have condemned Joe's remarks. These types of public blunders by a key member of a publicly traded company can have serious consequences for price on the short term. This may be important  DD for anyone who holds $pltr. This incident in my mind calls into questions the quality of leadership of the founders. How the board handles this may restore confidence or reduce it. Additionally, as a frequent government contractor issues like this can quickly gain great scrutiny should the media or politicians take a side in this controversy.  Again, in my mind this clearly calls into question Palantir's practices for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and may single more risks in the topic under the covers.  


The right/wrongess of this situation will likely be in of the eye the beholder, will be interesting how stock price reacts to this news.

When asked for clarification, Joe stated and later deleted:

>That's one dumb hypothesis race baiters may have taught you.  
  
>  
>A real view: average black culture needs to stop it up and stop having as many kids born out of wedlock (statistical indicator of underperformance) / who don't value education or spend as much time on homework.

Finally, reviewing rates of wedlock in black communities vs white in the US its clear... there is not a significant historical disparity between races. 

[https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/an-analysis-of-out-of-wedlock-births-in-the-united-states/)

  
It is further very unclear how this explains VC's low rate of black founder funding. A recent Washington Post article clearly places the blame on systemic and overt racism embeded in the industry.

## Here's How DiDi Looks To Hong Kong Listing

&#x200B;

* China's ride-hailing giant **DiDi Global Inc** (NYSE: DIDI) looks to 'listing by introduction' to gradually allow owners of Didi U.S. shares to transfer them to the city's bourse, Channel News Asia reports.
* Now it can list shares in Hong Kong without raising capital or issuing new stock as it seeks to delist from New York.
* Didi aims to file for the Hong Kong listing by April and list by June.
* Didi is moving towards withdrawing from the U.S. under pressure from Beijing over pursuing its IPO despite a regulatory warning.
* Didi has picked Goldman Sachs, China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), and China Construction Bank International (CCBI) to manage the Hong Kong listing process.
* **Price Action:** DIDI shares traded lower by 1.86% at $5.28 in the premarket session on the last check Wednesday.",1640809621.0

825,"NIO sucked this year, why it looks promising in 2022",rrga17,"Nio is down nearly 40% this year. I manage almost $250K worth of shares and call options so the pain is REAL. Can't afford the double-doubles anymore, have to buy singles w/ no drinks :(

So with that disclaimer, here's why NIO is a buy at this $28-30 range, aka now.

1. **Marketing/Strategy:** The Nio team have been textbook perfect in their execution.-It's paramount that an early stage startup targets and monopolizes a niche market of ""non-consumers"" before taking on the world. In the vein, Nio targeted the luxury EV market segment in China.

\-Furthermore, within the luxury Chinese EV niche, they targeted busy salarymen/women that couldn't afford to wait 30-minutes for a turbo-charge. A sub-10-minute battery swap addresses this market segment's need to replenish charge on the go. Furthermore, with cute ai-robots, passenger massage chairs, and a dealership that feels more like a country club, Nio has distinguished itself in its domestic market from non-native competitors like Tesla and BMW. This tightly controlled distribution strategy allows Nio to scale up safely while improving cash flow before they expand to new markets.-Nio then smartly targeted the Norwegian market, which has the highest per capita market share of EV's in the world. At Nio Day, they had Alan Walker (Norwegian musician) to headline the event.-Also at Nio Day, they revealed an expansion plan that includes most of Europe and the United States.

Net Result: Nio was able to hit 100K car deliveries in half the time it took Tesla (12-years), despite the chip shortage, factory shutdowns from the pandemic, and skyrocketing competition from incumbent players (We must still thank the almighty Tesla for being the pioneer, and on another post, I might outline why VW and GM will likely fail to take significant market share in the EV market).

2. **Pricepoint**\-Consumers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have been conditioned to allocate a monthly budget to pay for gas, oil changes, and maintenance fees. Nio offers a subscription fee to lease the battery, which is the most expensive component of an EV. Not paying for the battery up front dramatically reduces the cost of the vehicle, expanding customer acquisition, and also increases the lifetime value (LTV) of each customer. A luxury car like the ET5 can cost just $40K (comparable to the Model 3 or a BMW 3-Series), yet those same customers will be paying Nio's subscription fees for years and become loyal customers over time.

3. **Partnerships**\-Nio is changing the way we think about ""gas"" and ""gas stations"". They partnered with China's largest oil and gas station company, **Sinopec**, to build more battery swap stations. They also partnered with **Royal Dutch Shell**, to again, build more swap stations. They are fundamentally changing the ecosystem in a way that Li and Xpev are not.-Nio is also going to collaborate with BYD to build an affordable consumer line of cars. Imagine EV's that cost as much as a Honda Civic. With the BaaS model, this is possible.

4. **Case Study**\-Nio reminds me a lot of failed EV startup, **Better Place. Better Place,** had a charismatic founder with a talented engineering team. They were the first to implement a Battery as a Service model and built battery swap stations across Israel.The key difference? Better Place brand was not very recognizable. They didn't spend money on marketing because they spent way too much cash on building the costly swap stations and Renault cars that had to be repurposed for swaps. Better Place went bankrupt after selling around 1K cars.-Quick reminder, Nio sold over 150K cars to date in a shorter amount of time, and have formed the necessary partnerships to scale their swap stations worldwide. Nio also has the cultural benefit of Tesla, which paved the way for the EV market and changed consumer expectations of EV's.

**5.** **Substitution Curve: The Sleeping Giant**\-The adoption of disruptive technologies tends to follow an S-curve--slow, seemingly low-slope linear adoption rate for the first couple years, followed by what seems like an abrupt, massive expansion, and finally, an asymptotic move towards 100% adoption by late-comers.-If you plot the EV market (v.s. ICE market) on this curve on a logarithmic scale, with the y-axis having percent market share and x-axis being a timeline, we're literally at the halfway point of reaching full disruption, that is, we have about 4-7% market share of EV's right now (depending on the source), which is absolutely insane considering the global disruption of the pandemic in 2020.But anyhow, according to this curve, in 9-10 years, EV's will reach near 100% market share. With Nio, we don't have to wait 10 years---every new milestone and increased delivery figures, will de-risk the stock and increase Future Revenue projections (less discounts). That means if ET5 sales really do blowout expectations (rumors on 100K pre-orders), and if the European market contributes a meaningful, stable number of sales, and if it lists on the Hong Kong stock market to improve liquidity, Nio will become a huge investment in only the next couple years. Don't miss the boat.

**6. So why are we down so much**\-**Chinese Stock and De-Listing Fears:** Look at DiDi. Baba. CHL. Why should Nio be a safe place to park your money? Nio has been compliant at every step. They secured a certificate from the UN's cybersecurity panel on compliance. They have also been extra compliant with the NYSE and China's respective commissions. This is because Nio needs America more than ever to breakout as a new Car supplier. China knows this. So does Elon Musk of Tesla. America (at least the politicians) needs Nio too, to increase job rates, and to hit the target for EV adoption. CEO, William Li, is also doing everything he can to avoid the Chinese billionaire crackdown/scrutiny. He professes to live domestically, in a studio apartment. He doesn't dress lavishly. And he is very vocal about coming from a working class background.-**Interest Rates vs. Growth vs. Value:** When the Fed Raises Interest Rates, Growth Stocks will tank as whales want to lower their beta by parking their money in safer bonds. As hinted at earlier, Nio has a tremendously large future revenue projection. When this is further de-risked by hitting the holy grail of profitability, shares will spike. This is what happened to TSLA in 2020. It's almost like a switch that opens the floodgates. The key to investing now is to avoid missing this inflection point. Ignore the 10 even 20 dollar fluctuations. We're talking hundreds of dollars in share price here.

**7. Tail Winds:**\-**Currency:** Chinese Yuan relative to the USD has been rising over the last couple months and is near all time highs. That means every profit generated per car equals more dollars on earnings reports.-**Listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange:** it was supposed to happen earlier this year according to rumors, but we're still waiting for it. It's dry powder as it is still very much on the table. It will provide further liquidity and volume for the Nio Stock.**-Upcoming ET5 and Norway Deliveries:**With the lack of hype, investors have low expectations. Anything that improves delivery numbers to greater than 15K on a given month will be huge for Nio.

TLDR - Nio has been textbook perfect as a business, thanks to validated learning samples provided by the successful Tesla and the failed but similar Better Place.-The FUD on China stonks is scary but doesn't apply to Nio as it has demonstrated meticulous compliance at every single step. Nio really wants to be a global player. They made that explicitly clear on Nio Day 2021.-EV Market's growth is on track to be exponential in the coming years. Tailwinds like new exchange listings and increasing Chinese currency valuations make Nio a clear winner that could potentially grow 10x from where it is now.

**Not convinced yet?**

One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""*insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise*."" – that means that an insider, a member of any company’s administration, will buy shares of their company, only if, according to its insider’s view that has, the company is valued significantly lower than the value which will be created in the future and will justify much higher prices.

... and in the case of REE, two insiders bought “heavily” totally $1.7 million at Q3 of 2021, when the price was $5.97 and $5.81.

**So, someone who buys now, at price range of $5.00 to $5.20 is roughly buying 13.5% lower than the insiders bought relatively recently**; he is therefore, in an advantageous position vs the insiders. ... and now tell me, how often the small investors find such “positive” conditions?",1640804228.0

879,$HIMX – the X’mas / New Year’s SQUEEEEEZE is ON!,rrf1ar,"**My** **Positions**

https://preview.redd.it/dgq6gbm0zi881.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49a6866bcbdbd8e7a8ee35ff58e03e82c49f74c1

Since my original DD on $HIMX was published on 7th Nov 2021, the stock has rallied \~27% to $14.7. I see fair value at around $29/share based on relative value analysis. 

The original DD is available here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qoy7os/himx\_a\_potential\_short\_squeeze\_play\_gme\_xmas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qoy7os/himx_a_potential_short_squeeze_play_gme_xmas/) 

**I believe we are now at the tip of a massive squeeze.** Why now, you ask? Because the short is clearly underwater and risk management would dictate, closing the position.

As of 15th Dec 2021 -> short interest was still 22.18m shares. Of the 170m shares outstanding, \~24% is owned by insiders, meaning float is \~130m shares. So, short as % of float is still very high, at roughly 17%. 

**If a squeeze materializes, its going to be beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**Is the short underwater?**

To figure out if the short is underwater, we need to try and figure out the short’s cost basis, and to do that, we look at when the short interest was accumulated and the stock prices at that point in time.

 

The big jumps in the short interest and the relevant stock prices at that time are below:

A> 14th to 28th May -> 6.5m shares -> stock was between $11.3 - $12.3

B> 30th July to 13th Aug -> 4.8m shares -> stock between $12.6 - $13.5

C> 31st Aug to 15th Sep -> 5.75m shares -> stock between $11.77 - $12.5

The weighted average share price for the above 17m shares short is roughly $12.3/share (a rough estimate)…and that, I believe is why we had a lot of resistance at $12.

The best/highest cost basis for the short would have been $13.5 (in August) – but with stock now close to $15, one has to wonder how long the stock will keep this position open, and not cover. 

If the average is indeed $12.3 as I calculate, then the short is underwater by 16% (ex cost of borrow). Is this really the best short in this market, when the stock is trading at a mere 5.9x EBITDA and 10.2x FCF and when peers are trading much higher. 

To be clear, I am making a big assumption here that the short will not have hedged using calls and / or even if hedged, would not use proceeds to increase the short position -> I mean, they can, but wouldn’t be a wise thing to do from a risk management perspective.

&#x200B;

**Short interest has been declining since results**

Another point to note is that short interest has been steadily declining since the peak of 25.9m shares on 29th October (pre results). Post results:

\- Between 29th Oct to 15th Nov -> short int declined -1.35m shares to 24.5m

\- Between 15th Nov to 30th Nov -> short int declined -1m shares to 23.6m

\- Between 30th Nov to 15th Dec -> short int declined -1.4m shares to 22.2m

In total, short interest has declined 3.65m over the last 2 months, since Q3 results were published. 

But we still has 22.2m shares short or \~17% of float still to go!

&#x200B;

**So what happens now?**

The price action is already interesting – but it is just about to get a whole lot more interesting IMO.

The short(s) is/are trying hard to push the price lower, to no avail. Take yesterday’s (28th Dec 2021) price action for instance.

As my twitter friend ""Mungerian"" notes in a recently published thread, daily volume was 2x the average on 28th Dec 2021 (6m+), yet he noted there were numerous short attack with 50-100k shares dumped periodically. He notes that despite an estimated 3 million shares shorted during the day, the share price only declined $0.21 or 1.5% in total, on a day when QQQ was just as equally red. 

This shows the relative strength of the shares, and of course, today (29th Dec 2021), the shares are up +7.2% as I write.

Despite continued shorting, the short’s strategy just isn’t working. **Any sensible PM would reconsider their position here and consider closing. IT IS TIME.**

&#x200B;

**So, where should $HIMX trade? What is the Fair Value?**

Shown below is an updated relative value sheet – where $HIMX is compared to other DDIC peers. As I noted in my previous post, not all of these businesses are direct comparables, yet, it helps us attribute a value to $HIMX shares, albeit theoretical.

The table shows that $HIMX is trading at a much lower multiple vs the average of its peers. The FV based on the RV analysis is \~$29share or +95% from current levels. 

 

**Conclusion**

I don’t know if we hit $29, and risk management would dictate accepting a nice gain beforehand and closing out the position - but what I do know, is that this story is just getting interesting – so, I am monitoring this very closely.

My plan was to exit in the $15-$18 area but hoping $20. Well, $25+ would certainly be welcome.",1640802744.0

In fact Morgan Stanley bought E\*trade for $13 billion, which is close to the current $15 billion market cap for HOOD. At 30% premium this would be $20 billion. But E\*trade has only 5 million users while HOOD has over 20 million, so this is a good deal.

I was looking at the [CFTC Data](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm), which shows the weekly position of Institutions, Hedge Funds, and other categories in the Futures and Options markets.

I found quite curious that for Treasury Notes Futures, the position of Hedge Funds and Institutions is basically the opposite. Let's look at an example: In the figure below we have the position of Institutions (orange) and of Hedge Funds (blue) on the 5Y Note Future. The same is true for all the other Treasury Futures.

As you can see it's almost exactly the opposite. Does anybody know the reason?

1101,TLRY MOON SEASON STARTS JAN 1ST.,rr7p8j,"Tilray has historically dumped in December and pumped in January, but ofcourse most of you won’t buy now and will FOMO in at 300%. 

Part of the reason for this dump are tax losses and it’s also why if you look at the last 4 years, it made significant gains in January. 

Some quick facts:

- The company is prepped to hit nearly 1B in revenue (4B forecasted for 2024). With a current 3.45B market cap, this alone is the first sign of it being clearly undervalued.

- Tilray is the largest cannabis company in the world. As the weed market grows (and rivals alcohol), so does tilray. if you look at the top 20 alcohol companies globally by market cap, the last spot on that list is 2x TLRY market cap. (Massive room for growth)

- Several alcohol companies acquired that bring in revenue right now as they wait for legalization 

-Massive player in Germany, who is on the cusp of legalization. It’s about to take advantage of a weed market that’s over 100B.

Don’t wait till legalization is announced before you buy in, that’s when the ship is already gone.

1. Stonks only go up.
2. EDIT2: Stock market is a casino where green happens to be much more often than red.

Here's what you need to do to never lose money in the market again.

Step 1. Wait until SPY goes down 5% from its all-time high. Then put 5-10% of your portfolio into 1- or 2-year slightly OTM SPY call options. The rest can be kept either in cash or SPY ETF.

Step 2. If the market goes down by 10%, add more money into slightly OTM call options expiring in 9 months -1 year until at least 10-15% of your portfolio is dedicated to calls and the rest is in cash/SPY ETF.

Step 3. If the market is down 15% then buy more slightly OTM call options expiring in 6 months until your portfolio is 20% in calls and the rest is in cash/SPY ETF.

Step 4. Continue doing this and if the market is down 30% keep averaging down in options (buying 2-3 months out in this case) until you reach at least 60% of your original amount held in options. The rest of the money can be kept either in cash or SPY ETF.

By the time, the market is down 30-50% JPOW will return with a printer and take your broke ass to infinite tendie land. THIS COULD BE A FINANCIAL ADVICE BUT I'M NOT SURE SO GTFO

EDIT. You can also apply more aggressive expiration dates if it's within your personal risk tolerance :)",1640777393.0

As of press time, Apple shares are trading at $179.67, and given the possibility of a ""Santa Claus run"" in the near future, Apple is close to reaching the next trillion dollar threshold. However, with history, this may not be a good thing for the broader market.

1285,I have the dumbest strategy when buying stocks.,rqw7pl,"It's so fucking dumb.

The idea is basically that there are black swan events that will happen in the future that tank stocks. However, there are also going to be white swan events that boost companies to the moon.

My strategy is this: buy companies that have the highest likelihood of having white swan events. Because you can't predict a white swan you can't price it in... So if you own a company before a white swan you can make a killing.

This is critically different from speculation because I'm not putting a price target on anything. I'm not betting on X happening. None of that. 

Now, obviously I'm not just buying random companies. I'm making sure that the companies are financially sound before I actually buy shares--no crazy start ups that don't have a product yet... No Nikola stocks.  No Rivian stocks. None of that shit. It has to be a company that's doing well right now.

So right now my main long-term holdings for my dumb strategy are AMD, TSLA, PLTR, and NVDA. 

I'd say the one with the most potential is pltr because their business model is the most scalable out of all 3 and they do nothing but sign contracts, anyone of which could be a white swan.

* Stocks in the United States fell for the first time in five days, owing to a sell-off in megacap technology stocks.
* The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, retreating from the benchmark's 69th record close on Monday. The Nasdaq 100 retreated after four-day rallies for companies such as Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet. Nonetheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained positive due to reopening beneficiaries such as Walt Disney and Boeing.
* Trading was choppy as thin volumes exaggerated moves, with shares changing hands in the major benchmarks about a third lower than daily averages for the previous 30 days.
* Global equities are on track for a third year of double-digit returns, fueled by the surge in the United States. Analysts are still optimistic about earnings forecasts, despite coronavirus outbreaks and a shift by some key central banks toward tighter monetary policy to combat high inflation.

1331,MRNA is a $30 stock,rqtos2,"I don't do DD.  I look at things from a 10000 foot view.  From my elevation Moderna looks way overvalued.  In December of 2018 Moderna's IPO was the largest biotech IPO in history valuing the company at an incredible $7.5B.  At the time they were touting their research into mRNA as ""the software of life"".  The news story that I read said that there was "" no mRNA-based drug has ever been approved by the FDA nor any other regulatory agency, so it will be years before Moderna will be able to bring anything to market"".  Well that changed pretty quickly and the market went crazy.  Taking the crazy valution from $7.5B to $200B before backing off to the current $100B.  Does the fact that they came up with a fairly effective vaccine (and we don't want to get into the whole debate here about how effective it was) mean that they should now be valued at 12 x what they were worth when they IPO'd?  I say no.  The next drug that they come up with is going to have to go through regular clinical trials and won't have the advantage  of being needed by every human being on the planet.  So what is it worth?  I gave my prediction away in the headline.  For  the first 18 or so months of its existence it was a $20 stock.  Their tech is now a bit more proven so in my mind I'll give them a 50% bump.  That makes it a $30 stock.  I also think that it's going to go down faster than most people think.  Here in Canada, where we have a much higher vaccine acceptance rate, there is resistance to the booster.  Tens of thousands of available appointments are going unfilled in the midst of the Omicron wave.  Covid is largely being ignored.  The government is advising against travel yet everyone I know is travelling for the holidays.  No one that I know cancelled a trip because of Omicron.  If the plane was leaving, they were going to be on it.  When you hear that someone has Covid now you kind of feel badly for them because they have to isolate for a few days.  You're not worried that they are going to die.  Is this a population that is going to rush out and get the booster.  no way.  There's talk of changing the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include a booster but I can't see the political will to do that when the population is effectively ""voting"" by abstaining.  Politician's first job is to get elected and second job is to get re-elected.  They know that.  When there is a 70% uptake in vaccines they can  come up with mandates.  When there is a 40% (I made that number up) uptake in boosters, they won't be quite so quick to mandate them.

I picked Moderna and bought long $70 puts.  I think that Novavax would be just as good a target.

Check out the graphs near the bottom of this link (tldr: they go up)
[Auto Debt](https://wallethub.com/edu/cl/auto-financing-report/10131)

Not sure when, but it is clear that the US auto industry is cranking due to chip shortage and inflation.  But many people are still not working, or are quitting, and have mounting debt.  Auto has razor thin margins to begin with, most of which comes from financing or repair shop.

**Cause of death**

&#x200B;

[Top causes of death for 2019 according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm):

(2020-2021 not reported yet.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Heart disease: 659,041

Cancer: 599,601

Accidents (unintentional injuries): 173,040

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 156,979

Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 150,005

Alzheimer’s disease: 121,499

Influenza and pneumonia: 49,783

Intentional self-harm (suicide): 47,511

&#x200B;

Your insurance company knows the leading causes of death for Americans before these statistics are released to the public. However, many journals now agree that COVID-19 is the 3rd most common cause of death in 2020-2021. Health insurers have started to add clauses that stop payout relating to COVID related short and long term health issues. Car insurance has spiked to highs even with less traffic on the roads.

**Funeral costs**

&#x200B;

Writing in an October 24, 2013, issue of Bloomberg Businessweek, journalist Paul M. Barrett found, despite its lower overhead, SCI has higher prices than independent funeral home operators. Barrett quoted ""data compiled"" by a ""'concierge' funeral planning service"" Everest Funeral Package, which found that for ""**traditional funerals, SCI charges $6,256 on average (excluding casket and cemetery plot), 42 percent more than independents.**""[\[16\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-24/is-funeral-home-chain-scis-growth-coming-at-the-expense-of-mourners) In reply, **SCI points to ""overwhelmingly positive responses"" on customer surveys, below market wages paid to staff and management, and states they provide ""top value"" at a variety of funeral price points.**

&#x200B;

Golly gee is that bullish or what?

&#x200B;

[Average cost of funerals have gone up since and to match, SCI is still charging more than it's local competitors. Truly the Cadillacs of funerals, wakes, and death. Funerals are already booked months in advance thanks to our favorite virus.](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/costs/funeral)

According to a 2021 report by the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), **the national median cost of a traditional funeral with a viewing is $7,848**.

According to the same NFDA report, **the national median cost of an adult cremation funeral with a visitation is $5,365**.

&#x200B;

**Dignity** (a SCI brand) is charging well over 10 grand, way above average, for a closed casket funeral and that's just the basic option. Make sure you $ROPE instead of shotgun in the mouth when you blow up your portfolio on puts.

There are 3 different flavors to play this:

&#x200B;

The /r/thetagang:

Sell low volume covered calls and puts to degenerate apes that will buy FD's on this. Pocket Theta.

&#x200B;

The /r/dividends

Load up on shares. This company is going to consistently buy back shares and pay out dividends. The US population is aging and health insurance gets more expensive everyday while wages trend lower. It's the most consistent gamble of all time. **No one cheats death.**

&#x200B;

The /r/wallstreetbets

Buy FD options for earning coming up February 14, 2022 or Buy FD's depending on how deadly the future Pi, Rho, and Sigma variants are.

They currently have significant sales in phones, tablets, monitors, vr, televisions, and automotive. They are a technical leader in this field. In the last two weeks at a conference the ceo of continental hyped their relationship. This semiconductor company has a 75%+ yoy growth like many people during this time frame but this wasn’t during a downturn but a period of high growth. They have posted 4 straight quarters of 15%+ qoq or sequential growth. As of today it trades with a trailing pe of 6.14 and forward pe of 4.64. This is lower pe then other companies only growing 1% yoy. One of the chairmen with the most shares in the company recently announced he was buying another 10M worth of shares. They are also shifting a lot of production to automotive where they have dominant market share, the highest margins, and already supply tier ones in Japan, south Korea, Europe and the USA. Their latest display driver has one of the most advanced local dimming features critical for high contrast conditions and yet it’s one of the lowest power options on the market. 

Now the short % is only 14% of outstanding shares so this isn’t going to 100 but this is an opportunity to buy a growing company with awesome fundamentals that could easily double by 2024. The shares popped yesterday and this morning volume was high usually pointing to shorts accumulating to continue to apply short pressure to try and limit losses. If the buying pressure can keep this flat or positive then I think we will start to see a continuing of their rise over the past month. This is not financial advice and I have shares and 2023 and 2024 leaps.

Good luck and as always do your own dd.",1640711780.0

1526,Forecast Future Stock Prices with ML Models | WebApp,rqkk8g,"Hello Guys,

I have built a Web Application to help you to see the prices of a stock in the future up to 4 years via Machine Learning model. I built 4 ML models, which are Facebook's Prophet model, Artificial Neural Network model, Linear Regression model and Decision Tree model. All the models use 10 year historical data of the inputted stock and parameters like Open, High, Low, Volume and Adj Close, to predict the stock prices .

Forecasted and Actual Stock Prices are plotted on the chart for each model. Of course forecasted data extends into the future so the plotted line goes beyond the line with actual stock prices.

link: [webapp](https://share.streamlit.io/nikitaizmailov/ml_models_stock_price_prediction/main/main_algos_updated.py)

P.S. Allow 15-30 seconds for the website to load all the dependencies for the models to process the data and produce forecasted data.

P.P.S It seems that the app breaks every hour due to high traffic and streamlit servers can’t consistently maintain it, so will move it to AWS in the near future.

P.P.P.S Everything now works and the app is not breaking anymore. Thank you guys for your patience. 

Hope you like it and waiting for your feedback! It took me a week to build it, so I will appreciate any feedback to improve this project further.",1640711518.0

1553,"COVID is over, rate hikes coming.",rqj6u1,"No one is reporting on the fact that NY has a 83% vaccination rate (70% if you follow the ""fully vaccinated"" goalposts), but their covid cases are up 3x above pre-vaccination (yes thats right, before vaccines existed) amounts. By itself this data is indeterminate, but the deaths have not budged AT ALL, and ICU hospitalizations are going DOWN. COVID has done cucked itself into a regular seasonal flu. Everyone I know in NY that is vaccinated is getting omicron. No politician wants to touch mandates with a 10 foot pole and people are fed up with following guidelines, I think covid is just going to slowly fade out of the news.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some below were curious about how other places further along into the spike look and how places with a lower vax rate look, kindly check out South Africa (third world country with poor health infrastructure) and Alabama (third world country with poor health infrastructure and incest)  numbers. They all support the idea that omicron is castrated covid.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Short vaccine companies in a few months, long industrials and anything bottlenecked by supply chain issues, short car insurance companies, long travel, long oil

1761,"$U United we make tendies, Unity software DD 🚀🚀🌕🌕",rq7i8c,"**TLDR;** Unity is the only possible option to directly invest in 3D gaming engines with physics which are essential for creating Metaverse and VR games as other possible option Unreal engine (Owned by Epic Games) is not publically traded. Unity Software Inc. is a true FD.

[Remember the logo from ur Fav childhood games ??](https://preview.redd.it/vg3ts1l3n7881.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7fb82c85beb7e8aa1ab75cbaf711fcc4f3273a6)

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Software Inc., ($U), first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s ($AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console, and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pokémon Go, Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, Beat Saber, and Cuphead. It is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences.

I can give you insight as a VR/AR engineer who uses Meta's Oculus to $MSFT's Holo lense to develop games in 3D. Unity is much easier and has fewer bugs compared to the Unreal engine. Unity provides a free trial of their pro version to students making them a choice among future VR engineers.

* **Now, let's get into some financials**,

The revenue growth shows a steady increase over the past three years,

[Past three years' revenue increase](https://preview.redd.it/opqmv0p7o7881.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=478e8c22551bca065bf5562fa4cee15703b19a40)

Company beats Wall street's expectations in last quarterly results by 7.49%

[Last quarterly result](https://preview.redd.it/n0vs3is2s7881.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=17dd56cf15af329f558229897c50f3c11c927a8f)

No wonder king of Metaverse Mark wanted to get all of its action by trying to acquire it back in 2019[(Link)](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/facebook-mulled-multi-billion-dollar-acquisition-of-unity-book-claims/).  Zuck saw something that we did not? Right now, the company is burning cash like never before to keep their crown of the top choice by giving away a taste of their software for free to students with cheap tech support. (Excellent customer experience gets you, lifelong customers)

Here is the current and next year's expectations

Right now, the operating expense is around 140% of the revenue for 2021

The goal of Unity is not to generate profits but to exile their competition to make them a SOLE PROVIDER of the software tools for Metaverse.

To make the Metaverse more realistic, the recent acquisition of Weta (I know, Meta with a W) might suggest improvement of some ART or NFT in Metaverse.

The spy has had 4 Green Day’s in a row. This has to mean a red day is on its way. Trading on margins a beautiful thing isn’t it. Anyways, I’m pretty sure newton said something about correlation equaling causation or something along those lines. Something about the market just seems really positive right now. Kind of like in a Jaws movie where the water is very calm right before the bite. Wouldn’t be surprised to see a retest. See you tomorrow when I catch a 50 bagger nerds. 😎

And, if the S&P did move sideways completely you just cut your losses and sell because max loss on first day is nothing. Sure, bid ask spread is annoying but it won't take too much of your money. I did some math and, if it's a green day, on average it's about +0.65% which means that on average you're gonna be profitable. And if it's a red day it's around -0.55% which still makes you profit.

""When the Commission first became aware of payment for order flow practices in the OTC market in late 1984, the Division of Market Regulation (""Division"") wrote to the National Association of Securities Dealers (""NASD"") to express its concerns and to request that the NASD ""consider possible measures to address any problems observed in this area. In the ensuing years, the Commission has requested information from the NASD and the exchanges to determine the extent of payment for order flow practices.""

You can return Amazon products for free  back to a KSS store. Not only you don’t need to package it but you also get a Kohl’s discount in cash.

This partnership drives a lot of store traffic mainly for folks who do not live in a managed building where you can leave your  package with the doorman.

This is much simpler that other options and sometimes these customers make purchases in the store.

In the last 3 years I visited Kohl’s 5 times and it was always to make a return for Amazon. I always got discount dollars and 4 times I spent more than $100 in the store.

I went again today and it was full of people returning Amazon products, I know it’s post holiday and you would see more but this is still potential customers walking in.

PS. They are debt free, growing double digits a year and pay dividends.

1. Because of the current COVID situation I believe most people turned to online shopping and used Amazon, Target, and Walmart. 

2. Most stimulus money was spent before the holidays and now people are using BNPL services such as AFRM to fund their purchases. 

3. People are going to use their tax return to pay off what they owe to the BNPL companies such as AFRM.

2086,$HIMX: crossing 13$ and starting a new bull run,rptdb5,"I’ve been on HIMX for more than a month now and I’ve done a bunch of detailed DD on the company.

Turns out the stock is extremely undervalued and an has enormous upwards potential. Earnings have been massively growing in the last few quarters and they are expected to continue like this into the next year.

The stocks development in the last weeks has proven that a new bull run has started and it’s gonna last. 
Even the bearish price targets indicate an increase up to 17$ at least (Credit Suisse has it at 23$).

In my opinion, the stock’s gonna reach 25$ at least by mid 2022. How long the increase is gonna take is not clear tho as it could go much quicker. Some possible catalysts could be Q4 earnings in February and the slight pressure from shorts to cover (only an SI of 20ish % so nothing huge).

At its base, this simply is a value play. Himax is a great company with huge future potential and massively growing earnings. Both of these aspects just haven’t been priced in by the market.

To conclude, I stay highly bullish on this stock and I’ll keep riding it till I can buy a house in the Philippines and don’t ever have to work again.

Further positives:

* Highly profitable (important for upcoming tapering environment)
* Whole metaverse thing could be huge
* No Facebook isn’t dead, see instagram

Risks:

2107,KNBE is grossly underrated,rpskts,"Hello fellow apes. I've been watching the market for the last few months looking for something I believed in. I really think KNBE will be a big stock in the coming months. Here's why:

1. Tech has seen giant growth the last 10 years, and I don't think I am alone in thinking cybersecurity is the next big thing. Knowbe4 is one of the leading cybersecurity companies from what I've seen, and their antiphishing seems to be fairly successful. 

2. They are relatively new to the market and no one is paying attention. Their daily trade volume barely exceeds 500,000. Everyone seems to have messed around with some KNBE when it came out, but that dropped real quick. They had a spike and a drop because no one is paying attention to it right now. My guess is, that is about to change in early February because of number 3.

3. The major thing that I think will send KNBE up crazy numbers (I'm  estimating somewhere around 40 dollars per share) is the show that they produce. KNBE hasn't been on the market during any of their previous season releases of inside man, so there hasn't been a precedent sent for their stock. I still think a lot of people will be jumping in when that drops.

4. For the final nail in the coffin, Knowbe4 is on Glassdoors' top places to work. I looked at the top businesses on that site over the last 10 years, and using it as a predictor has shown great gains over the market. Even when you take google and fb out of the equation, those companies, on average, perform way better than S&P. 

One thing that worries me is their focus on phishing. I don't know how sustainable staying in that market alone is, and, for the long run, they will have to do soemthing else.

Long story short, buy KNBE idiots, how haven't you seen this shit yet. Happy New Years.

Edit: Wrote 150,000 instead of 500,000. Also, including post hours trading, KNBE has jumped like 1.70 today.",1640626430.0

2150,"Canoo($GOEV) CEO expected to have bought 16,577,701 more shares last Thursday",rprak9,"Canoo's CEO (Tony Aquila) runs an investment fund called AFV Partners that is buying enormous chunks of Canoo stock. On November 22nd he bought 35 million shares for a little over $230 million. [filing here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390021061224/ea151207-13da4aquila_canoo.htm).  On December 10th he bought 3.6 million shares for $21 million. [filing 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390021065248/ea152331-13da2remark_canoo.htm) [filing 2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390021065249/ea152332-13da5ddglobal_canoo.htm). On the 23rd he was expected to have bought 16,577,701 more shares (see item 6 in [this sec filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390021061224/ea151207-13da4aquila_canoo.htm)). He has 2 business days to file the form 4 (confirms and provides information on the purchase). This means it will either be filed in After Hours today or After Hours tomorrow. This new purchase would means he has bought 55 million shares in one month.

He's making these purchases so a chinese owner's shares remain locked up until April, but he is damn near buying the chinese owner out in the process. He is also exercising options that don't expire for years and is buying more than he has to.

This is possibly the most bullish indicator ever. Most of the time when a CEO controls that many shares it's because he originally founded the company. While the purchases are through his investment fund, he is still heavily invested in said fund. And in a time where the other EV spac CEOs are selling their shares like they're the plague, Tony is casually buying 55 million shares. And no one is talking/reporting on it.

While he is getting a little discount on the shares, it's not like he's looking to quickly flip them for a profit. He is buying them from the large chinese shareholders too, which is another big positive (assuming less chinese ownership is good).

tldr: CEO has bought 55 million shares in a one month time frame, Form 4 coming during AH either today or tomorrow,  extremely bullish

Energy names are also being hit before today’s open as rising cases and cancellations could trigger demand fears. Rising cases have pushed authorities in some Chinese cities to toughen restrictions on their current lockdowns.”

Just curious as to why SPY is up so much given the fact that Omicron has surged over the weekend and so many Christmas flight cancellations.

And if you never heard of this brand, neither have I before this announcement. I just went on Amazon to check out their products, because financial details don't seem to be available anywhere. They seem popular and well reviewed by customers. 

So this Hey Dude company sells simple looking comfortable shoes, aligns pretty well with Crocs core business. Crocs are projecting $700 mil revenue added from this acquisition. Why did the stock tank then? I think wall street is being cautious because the company is private, and not much information is available.

Well I'm bullish simply because Crocs management proved to be incredibly competent, they managed to completely dodge any sort of supply chain disruptions, and continued to grow in that environment, while their peers didn't. And synergies between the companies seems to be there. I think Crocs as a brand is very underestimated in general, and trades at a reasonable p/e, they have fans in every demographic. 

I'm going into this on very little information, I'll be honest, but it just seems like common sense. Dip looks good. Chart looks promising as well.

2351,$ZIM offers exceptional value and several upcoming catalysts for a dramatic revaluation in Jan/Feb,rpg7n4,"For those of you who don't know, $ZIM is a large ocean freight company. There have been several great DDs about the incredible value play ZIM is, and I encourage you to read them. I'll provide a brief summary of those key points here, but most of this DD will instead focus on why I believe there is incredible short-term opportunity here.

**Part 1: The Value Play**

ZIM's business model has been to do medium-to-long term leases on cargo ships then use them to mostly service the spot freight market. As you likely know, Cargo rates have skyrocketed over the last two years and this has given ZIM considerable success. They've paid down 100% of their debt and are currently sitting on over $30/share in cash (factoring in Q4 here).

So what is fair market value for a company with $30 in cash, no debt, and cashflows $5-12 per QUARTER? I can assure you it is *well above* $53.66.

**Part 2: The Bear Fallacy**

If I were to guess what the ZIM shorts are thinking, it would be something along the lines of: ""yes, ocean freight rates are sky high right now, but they're about to come way down and ZIM's forward earnings potential is now quite limited.""

This is quite narrow minded. I have read this same statement for the last 18 months, and yet the rates aren't fallowing. In fact, let's take a look at the [Shanghai Containerized Freight Index](https://en.sse.net.cn/indices/scfinew.jsp).

[All time high as of Christmas Eve.](https://preview.redd.it/jyurc3wjp0881.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b9b5f55c5dedc4021112470d0c7dfb62b08993)

But I thought [rates](https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3151640/china-us-shipping-rates-begin-cool-power-crisis-forces) are [supposed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-11/supply-chain-latest-container-shipping-rates-are-drifting-lower) to be going [lower](https://qz.com/2091274/shipping-lines-have-reached-the-peak-of-their-pricing-power/)? Lol.

Well we are now starting to see the tides turn as there are more reports of [increased shipping costs in 2022](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shipping-and-logistics-costs-are-expected-to-keep-rising-in-2022-11639918804?st=5bs0hjsl70wi372&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter). But perhaps even more compelling for the value argument of ZIM, we are seeing companies [locking in contracts at record levels](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/container-shipping-xeneta-data-indicates-that-most-of-the-2022-contracts-will-be-at-record-high-levels/). Remember, ZIM's business model to date has largely been to operate on the spot market - but ZIM is under good management and they will do what is right. Lets listen to their conference call...

>**Analyst**  
>  
>But did want to ask because we did see some reports and some discussions for the Asia-Europe legs that we were seeing freight contracts being entered into that were as long as 36 months in duration. And just wanted to ask, did you see that type of interest? I know it's a small piece of your business, but did you see that type of interest? And also, are there any indications that we could be seeing something like that on the transpacific? I know it's early, but any color you can give on that?  
>  
>**Xavier Destriau** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
>  
>...So through the Atlantic, Asia, and Europe, we've heard and read the same thing as what you're mentioning right now Omar. As far as we are concerned now, we have some customers that throw the idea as to whether longer-term more than 12 months is something that the company would entertain.  
>  
>We haven't made a final decision here as of yet. First of all, for us, the primary question that we want to give an answer to internally is what is the allocation in terms of contract cargo versus spot that we want to secure for the next season. And then when we focus on the percentage of contract cargo, whether those are going to be 12 months as it used to be the norm or in some cases more than that will be subject to the discussions that we will have with each and every customer. But a little bit too early for us to comment on this at this stage.

To me, this demonstrates that ZIM is being thoughtful about when they begin agreeing to long-term contracts at secured rates. *Let me be very clear: If ZIM locks in 12-month contracts at rates even significantly discounted from current spot, the 12 month cashflow would put us well above the current market cap.*

**Part 3: The Catalysts**

As with most of my plays, I like to include upcoming catalysts that I believe may convince the market that the company is wrongly valued. For ZIM, there are several:

1. Rates not magically falling after Christmas, leading to more mainstream news stories of sky-high freight rates.
2. ZIM locks in long-term contracts or provides a general update on this strategy.
3. In response to a published frustrated shareholder letter on the lack of buybacks, ZIMs CEO agreed to speak with the author. When this began to get popular on a certain stock blogging site, the CEO decided to cancel that 1-on-1 call and move the discussion to a more public forum set for ""early January."" We may get significant updates then.
4. Given ZIMs ridiculously low value, we could even see the company attempt to go private. \[NOTE: There are hurdles here due to Israeli government stake.\]
5. Importantly and commonly missed: The January call options of strikes between $50 (recently OTM) and $63 have >70,000 OI. That is over 7,000,000 shares; 6% of the company; almost $375 million worth. And there's almost a full month to expiry. If we see continued buying in these options we very well could see a gamma squeeze.

**Part 4: YOLO**

2401,Student loan crisis will cause SLM to tank,rpcsb9,"The Biden administration previously said that the last extension was the LAST. We now know that’s not true, as it’s been extended yet again to May. It’s foolish to think that students will see enough economic gains between now and May in order to allow to payments to resume due to A) inflation running out of control, B) job maker resistance to raise wages to match inflation, and C) persistent supply chain issues that will continue through 2023, causing intermittent and inconsistent amounts of work in manufacturing and retail, further decreasing job security in what are typically considered as relatively stable job sectors. This will culminate in  a large amount of social unrest, just as the weather starts getting nicer, giving a higher likelihood for marches and protests against resuming payments. Delay again is almost guaranteed, and I think talks of cancellation will come back to the table. Whether or not cancellation happens is moot to the fact that people will panic at the discussion and unload their SLM causing it to drop. 

Disclosure: I own 3 puts at $13 for 5/20 because that’s all I would have had to make towards student loan payments next month had they resumed. 


TLDR: people will not be able to afford their student loan payments by May and that will be real bad news for SLM. Buy puts.",1640573493.0

how can I short US treasuries with high leverage(x200). I live in Germany and have TradeRepublic, but I would get a new Broker just to go short on US Bonds. Is it even possibly to short bonds? Goolge is not very helpful.  And another question is, which Bond exactly I should go short on. I think US treasuries are fine, because interest rates in the US go up definitly, so bonds will lose. 30-year isn't that good because the deacrese of value would be to small. I guess 5-year and 10-year bonds will do great.

2773,$FB is severely undervalued.,rol8o0,"In the past 5 years the company had a 30%+ revenue CAGR, ~40% operating margin and a consistently increasing ROA (more conservative metric than ROIC) of 18-24%.



Even if you assume 16%-20% revenue growth in the next 5 years followed by a no-growth period and a RONIC of only 20%, Meta is at least a $430 stock based on my model. 



The controversies around the company + low ESG scores are keeping institutional investors away at the moment, but these controversies come and go as they always do with $FB.",1640478999.0

2851,The reasons why stock market only goes up.,rog1nv,"Here are the axioms:

1. Inflation exists.  Money saved in the bank is being inflated away for any individual/institution.  Inflationary pressure forces spending/investment.

2. Money must go somewhere.  People/institutions that sold stocks for cash, which loses value over time, must reinvest the cash back to the market at some point.

3. 401k/Retirement/wealth management automatically purchase investment assets.  A portion of everyone's salary is automatically invested into the market.

4. The US stock market is 55% of the world market and attracts capital from all over the world.  Stocks are being boosted not just by American firms and individuals, but people from all of over the world allocate their wealth in the US market and hedge against their own domestic inflation and uncertainties. 

5. QE. Fresh money is printed and put in the stock market.

Most importantly - FOLLOW THE MONEY: Where does the money go when someone sells their stock?  

1. If the money goes in the bank: The bank will invest or lend out that money, which will find its way back to the market.
2. If the money gets spent: It will find its way back to the market through the producer of the goods and services from 401k of employees, the investment/bank of the producer.

3. Reinvest at the ""dip"".

4. Invest in other assets like Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or commodities such as Oil, Silver and Gold.  Which arguably carries more risk or lower growth, and doesn't encourage national economic growth at the same level as the stock market. 

5. Invest in pre-IPO companies. Which sees most of the ROI when it goes public.

Money always find its way into the market.  The stock market is the engine that drives innovations and new business ventures.",1640461470.0

3086,China's Currency Trouble.,rnw9a8,"The Chinese Yuan is a volatile currency and they are highly likely to miss their inflation targets and runaway inflation is a very real possibility.

The trouble starts with China's distorted economic and demographic data. You will notice that China recorded steady population growth even when the one-child policy was in force. This can be explained away by how some people paid fines for each new child, others used ""birth tourism"" by traveling abroad when pregnant, some abused exceptions made in some localities, and others had their children in secret. However, this does not fully explain the continued population growth as there were still many forced abortions, there's a massive gender skew as families with only one kid prefer a boy who can take care of them when they are old, and many multi-generation families rely on one kid for all their fortunes.

The answer lies in the perverse incentives inside China's highly competitive hierarchy. Unlike most countries, internal allotment of resources is top down organized with the bulk of government resources going to handfuls of places judged strategically significant. One of the gauges used are rapidly urbanizing areas.

How the data is falsified is another matter. Much of China's population are migrant workers and Chinese people have provincial citizenship that is as vital as their national citizenship. Many of these are farmers that take temp jobs in the cities, while others simply work far from home and visit family only on the weekends, and yet more have migrated internally but the residency transfer costs money and is long and tedious. BUT you can be sure both local governments will count that person as a full time resident.

The means, motive, and opportunity to straight up fabricate population data is certainly there, but I am not aware of anyone getting busted for that... Yet.

The GDP data is likewise skewed, as China's officials are given bonuses, promotions, demotions, and even jail terms based solely on economic data. This highly perverse incentive means men will hide economic problems and there's no real secret about it. However, many creative means of boosting numbers regardless if it makes sense. For instance, some industries boost GDP numbers more than others, and the GDP only measures what it was SOLD for, not it's actual utility or worth.

In a more or less typical case, local officials may give construction contracts to firms owned by relatives or the lowest bidder. These builders fund themselves by preselling the houses. Construction is quick and cheap, and officials incentivize buying a house (often by making it a prerequisite for transferring residency). Since most local government revenue is from land leases and fees, this becomes very profitable for both the local government and the bosses REGARDLESS IF THE HOUSES COLLAPSE IN A SHORT TIME.

There's a lot more to this, but one of the reasons China's Housing Bubble was so inflated is due to Chinese officials boosting their GDP numbers. Other schemes involve fake/broken/shoddy green energy installations. A few officials have been busted for straight up fabricating GDP growth. This process is repeated at every level of government, so the numbers at the top have no bearing on reality. Important note is official GDP numbers record twice the yearly growth that tax revenues and stock index returns shown. But you can be sure the GDP will not only be presented as gospel truth but will be advertised all over as the reason to invest only in Chinese.

This fake GDP data makes their central bank's job very difficult. The People's Bank of China (PBC) once complained the zealous efforts to boost the economy. Gauging how much Yuan must be printed on a given day requires guesswork, and over the past decade the Yuan has increasing volatility with both short and mid term swings.

But perhaps worse is the very recent corruption bust of an executive from China's money printing company. Little is known about his crime other than he was arrested for ""corruption."" The implications of this bust are potentially huge, as individual Chinese bankers comment how a corrupt money printer could simply have two printers, one for himself and one for the government, and use the same serial numbers for both. These ""fake real bills"" would simply be impossible to detect even by banks with machines counting serial numbers.

Counterfeit money is a major problem all over the world and in China many large and sophisticated counterfeit schemes have been busted. This scheme, however, enables a limited number of people to access literally unlimited funds.

However, it should be noted that corrupt officials heavily prefer cash and personal items/favors that are easy to keep off books and spending the money is just as dangerous as getting it. China's largest corruption bust involved one official was found to have literally THREE TONS of cash. Another lady had a secret apartment full of luxury goods she was given but she couldn't be seen in public wearing. Another official became known as ""comrade wristwatch"" because he was constantly being seen wearing different rolex he couldn't afford. In all cases the guys at the center of corrupt scheme had money they could not risk spending in public.

I bring this up because the fake bills wouldn't have an immediate inflationary effect. Bricks of cash would change hands and sit in hiding places for a long time before getting to the open market. There is no illusion anywhere in China that the full extent of whatever corruption exists will be exposed. The suspects will confess to a minimal amount of crimes to evade punishment and the government would publish a minimal number of convictions to prevent panic.

We can also see the Chinese censors have exact same concerns as the general public as normally they remove posts and news articles concerning scandals within the Communist party. However, counterfeit money effects all of China equally. This mostly effects China itself as there are major restrictions on how much Yuan can be moved out of China.

But to be fair, it is not currently known whether or not there was fake real bills going on. In fact, the inciting news was only a few sentences long, but as one Chinese netizen said ""The shorter the article, the more important the news.""

All this is very important to those of you invested in Chinese stocks, as we all know when weird stuff happens to currency it tends to go down. Sometimes very explosively. In any case, the PBC is going to struggle to maintain inflation targets even if things aren't as bad as I fear they are.

 Hello Retard, 

Thanks for reaching out.

*You’ll be able to view your year-to-date gains and losses on your annual tax documents*. You can also check out your unrealized gains and losses in the app by tapping the stock price in your watchlist (iOS) or by tapping the three circle icon on the top of your Watchlist and selecting total gain/loss or total return (Android).

There's currently no other way to find realized gains through the app. **If you'd like, I can send you a PDF statement of your spreadsheet that will help you calculate realized gains up for 2021**, and you can use your history in the app or on the Web to update it.

Let me know if you have any further questions and if you'd like that spreadsheet.

Sincerely,

3120,I’ve Had an Epiphany (Or am I retarted? You tell me),rnu049,"I came up with a strategy that seems like a no brainer. Take for example the stock ABCL which finished the day trading at $14.93. Say you load up on 1000 shares resulting in a cost basis of $14,930. 

Now you decide to sell some covered calls; 10 contracts of $3 calls for a premium of $12.60 expiring January 2022.

10*100*$12.60=$12,600

If you assume a trading price of $14.93, with the remaining $12,600 you can buy 800 more shares and sell $3 covered covered calls AGAIN! 

Then from those 8 contracts you will get $10,080 in premium. Again, buy 700 more shares and sell more $3 calls. 

And so on and so on, you buy more shares with the resulting premium and sell more $3 calls until you reach a limit when you can no longer purchase the 100 shares required for a contract.

GM: $56.91 / 7.67 EPS = 7.4198174

F: $20.25 / 1.87 EPS = 10.828877

TSLA: $1067 / 5.04 EPS = **211.70634**

Where are investors like the people on r/wallstreetbets seeing the growth opportunity? TSLA has only had a positive income for 2020 and 2021 now but has a stock price of over $1000. You may turn a blind eye to this, but this will burn TSLA in the future I guarantee.

Meta can make the Facebook Marketplace accept cryptocurrency payments at the flip of a switch.  Facebook is currently the leading company for the metaverse development with unrivaled resources and userbase.  No other companies are better positioned to implement the innovations.  The upcoming earning is expected to be very optimistic with the wide expansion of innovative product lines and high growth to existing products such as the Facebook Marketplace.

3233,NVAX - Lambo or Ramen (Part II),rnobqt,"Here's a link to my part I - [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qezyzx/nvax_the_vaccine_play_so_bad_it_might_just_work/)

A few months ago, a Politico hit piece took this stock from roughly 260, down to as low as 120 almost over night. This created an excellent buying opportunity and I was able to load up on calls and cash in on these over the last couple of weeks.

Without a doubt, the article was used by a short fund (maybe multiple funds) to crash the price and cash in on their short position. The article cited ""anonymous"" sources within the FDA, stating that NVAX was incapable of producing their vaccine at scale. The company refuted the claims and shortly thereafter, they filed for EUA in multiple countries.

I'm sure there was some truth to the article, but it was clearly overblown as the company has filed for EUA across the world and has already been approved in multiple countries, including the EU and by the WHO, which gives them access to several dozen countries. As their CEO stated, ""you don't filed for EUAs, unless you have solved all your manufacturing problems.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this week, we saw WHO and EU approvals roll in only to see the price peak up to 245 (pre-market) Monday, then fall the rest of the week, all the way down to a close of 177 yesterday. Again, this created another great buying opportunity, as the stock is currently trading as less than 2x 2022 earnings. I believe average in bio-tech is roughly 7-8x.

If it's so great, why did it crash this week? I think there are 3 reasons.

1. Profit takers. I think a lot of people got in on this when it was trading around 130-150, knowing approval was almost guaranteed (in at 130, out at 230 for a nice $100/share profit in a couple of weeks).
2. Vaccine sector beat down. A lot of vaccine stocks, and other stocks with high valuations have been getting beaten down in recent weeks. For example, MRNA is down 50% from it's peak in August.
3. Short selling. It's obvious that NVAX is no fan of Wall Street. It's current short interest is reported at over 10%, according to Fintel.

&#x200B;

I believe short sellers took advantage of ideal market conditions, to drive this stock down on positive news. Look at these comparison graphs of MRNA and NVAX, to give you an idea of how manipulated these low float stocks can be. One of these stocks had great news with WHO/EU approval and positive immune results from the Omicron COVID stain:

[NVAX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/078d9tcmtj781.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515155ca4f9997fe99d99a018b183b7325818c76)

The other stock had poor results with the Omicron stain and is extremely overvalued.

[MRNA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/0r1zo7jptj781.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09fa27be874cbd14aef349cc76d0c2abfd950c5b)

Bad news, if you bought in PM Monday morning. However, good news if you had no position in NVAX previously.

I believe this is going to yo-yo back up well over 200 early next week, as they are set to file with the FDA for EUA before Friday (as stated multiple times by the company this week and previously).

My current position:

* NVAX 1/7/21 200c (100)
* NVAX 1/21/21 200c (25)
* NVAX 1/7/21 250c (40)
* NVAX 2/18/21 250c (20)
* NVAX 4/14/21 300c (10)

Fair warning, these options are expensive and risky. Don't play unless you enjoy pain. A more conservative (ie smarter) route is to buy shares and sell covered calls around the 250-300 strike price. If the stock doesn't moon, you'll collect big time premiums. If it does, fuck it, you doubled your money in a couple of weeks.

**TL;DR - I believe strongly that NVAX will rebound next week due to FDA EUA filing.**

&#x200B;

EDIT:

To expand on the FDA filing a little. I believe we will see the filing Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. I think this gives them the most headlines. I believe they had their paperwork ready this week, but held out for their Omicron data to come out. That's why their CEO kept saying ""within a few days."" They finally released their data Wednesday afternoon, which didn't give them enough time to file Thursday morning. For them to file Thursday afternoon or over the weekend would have totally wasted a golden PR opportunity.

You can see Stan's wry smile when the reporter asked if it was going to be this week (Thursday) or next week - [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html)

I am also 95% sure they will include their US manufacturing (not just SII). I believe the FDA is requiring this, which caused the extra delay.

The reason this is important is because this proves that they are able to globally manufacture their vaccine at scale, and it also give them higher margins for the doses they sell. This is currently the last bear case for the stock - they have a great vaccine, but they can't manufacture at scale and the only doses that they will be able to sell are low margin ones via SII.

If they do include US manufacturing in their filing next week, I'm pretty confident this will add 25-50% to their SP within 2-3 days.

3345,Aimia to the Moon ($AIM.TO) Crazy Value Play,rndyeq,"Recently saw some work and analysis on Aimia and thought it was quite an interesting opportunity and who doesn't want to make all their money back before the holidays

Aimia is an investment holdco. It has previously specialised in airline loyalty program companies, but now also holds a range of other businesses both public and private. It’s largest holding is a 48.9% stake in PLMPremier is a travel loyalty program operator (I.e. air-miles and credit card rewards) in Mexico, which is jointly owned by airline AeroMéxico.

Short Term Catalyst: AeroMexico is in the process of acquiring Aimia’s stake in PLMPremier (airline reward company). They are offering to pay the USD $375m plus Aimia’s share of the cash on PLMPremier’s balance sheet c. USD $57m which is a total of CAD $540m for a company that has a current market cap of CAD $430m. Reviewing the bankruptcy filings for Aeromexico it is pretty clear that this transaction is close to being finalized and would provide Aimia with more cash than their current market cap.

Taking just the cash from this transaction an expected $5.90 per share of cash will be generated vs the current share price of $4.70.

Seems pretty crazy to me that in such high valuation market there is the opportunity to buy a company who trades below their expected cash per share.

Curious to hear others thoughts.

3346,Higher Natural Gas cost are tailwind for Ammonia producers,rndxnc,"TTF Natural Gas high of $180, ranging in $140. Due to winter and Nordstrom tensions, a natural gas crunch has pushed various nitrogen-fertilizer plants to halt or curtail production.  

The ""...production of ammonia from natural gas is conducted by reacting methane (natural gas) with steam and air, coupled with the subsequent removal of water and CO2. The products of this process are hydrogen and nitrogen, which are the feedstock for the main ammonia synthesis.""

Not unsurprising, ammonia surged to a 13-year high to $910 a metric ton, and cost to make nitrogen fertilizer in Europe is going to get even pricier.

3353,KLIC - Kulicke and Soffa Inc is the cross I will die on this Christmas,rndl2y,"Happy Holidays fellow autists, long time lurker first time poster. Over the past week I have become unhealthily obsessed with the semiconductor industry, and have read more about this semi-obscure company than probably anyone in the Metro Los Angeles area which puts me high on the list of biggest dumbasses in the world.

From their website, we learn a bit more about this player in the semiconductor industry: *Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) is a leading provider of semiconductor and electronic assembly solutions serving the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing and industrial markets. Founded in 1951, K&S prides itself on establishing foundations for technological advancement - creating pioneering interconnect solutions that enable performance improvements, power efficiency, form-factor reductions and assembly excellence of current and next-generation semiconductor devices.* 

*Leveraging decades of development proficiency and extensive process technology expertise, Kulicke & Soffa’s expanding portfolio provides equipment solutions, aftermarket products and services supporting a comprehensive set of interconnect technologies including wire bonding, advanced packaging, lithography, and electronics assembly. Dedicated to empowering technological discovery, always, K&S collaborates with customers and technology partners to push the boundaries of possibility, enabling a smarter future.*

How does this affect me, you say? With the current proliferation of ever more complex electronics, the demand for machinery in this sphere has been exceptionally strong over the last year and projects to remain strong moving into 2022. The company is also ramping up production in new investments on advanced LED and mini/micro LED displays, automotive chip packaging, as well as memory solutions.

Here's the good part: this stock currently trades at a **P/E of 9.7**. Even better, the company has no debt, and offers a cute 1.19% dividend. They are actively buying back shares and have $739 Milllion in cash on hand to continue buybacks or make a key acquisition.

I am in for 71 shares, a cool 53% of my portfolio. While I don't understand options well enough to buy one yet I plan on buying up to and beyond 100 shares so I can recklessly bet my meager savings away in this manner. I may be a simple country retard, but I see value and a good metaverse/chip shortage/next gen LED play with tons of room to grow - do your own DD please and feel free to let me know why I am wrong here.

In conclusion, KLIC 🚀🚀🚀 and thank you for coming to my TED talk.

This makes absolutely no sense. A live music and event promoter emerging from the pandemic BETTER than before is dubious enough, then you add in the rest of the sentiment it makes even less sense.

The 2nd largest holder of $LYV is Melvin Capital, and in April 2020 the Saudi Arabian government bought a $500 million stake in the company (5.7% stake at the time). Even before the Travis Scott incident, Ticketmaster and Live Nation engaged in some seriously slimy shit, like scalping tickets from themselves to re-sell at higher prices on the secondary market.  Now they near an all time high after Congress investigates them and they face nearly $1 billion in civil lawsuits? During Monday’s sell off on omicron fears, LYV barely budged and they make money on people congregating together! 

Something stinks like shit. The bull case is that whatever they are doing is working. The bear case is that something is going to get exposed or run out of gas.

**S&P:**  **4,725.79 (+29.23) (+0.62%)**

**Dow:**  **35,950.56 (+196.67) (+0.55%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,653.37 (+131.48) (+0.85%)**

In time for the Holiday, the US markets cheered up with the S&P closing at a new record and shrugging off the worries that troubled in the beginning of the week. Fueled by optimism on the impeding Santa Claus rally next week the indices posted back-to-back sessions gains with most of the stocks in the green. The VIX continued to dip reflecting the market sentiment and closed at the lowest levels since the Thanksgiving weekend.

Tesla built upon the momentum of Musk’s closure of share sales and further buoyed by positive estimates of various analysts on the Q4 Tesla delivery numbers, jumped another 5% today to close at $1,067. The One Trillion Dollar EV maker promised to disable in-car videogame after US Highway safety regulator launched an investigation into the same.

Crocs shares plunged by more than 11% after the company said it has agreed to purchase casual-shoe brand Heydude for $2.5 Billion ($2.05 Bn in cash and $450 Mn in Crocs shares). Heydude makes ultra-light casual shoes that has seen digital sales increase 14x since 2018.

Shares of Micron Technology jumped another 4.5% today marking an impressive 15% gains since their stellar earnings report and positive management commentary. The stock closed at above $94 closely approaching its 52-week high price.  

Airlines and Cruise stocks had an impressive week despite the Omicron variant raging across the US and the world. In the last 5 trading days Carnival Cruise was up by more than 20% and AAL, DAL and UAL were all up around 10% with domestic travel remaining strong in the holiday season.

Electric semitruck maker Nikola’s shares surged by 18% on the news of their first customer delivery. The company’s shares closed at $11.09 still at a far-lower level than its mid-2020 levels. Other notable increases during this “trading week” in WSB’s favorite meme stocks that took a plunge recently include AMC, WISH, SDC, SNAP and PSFE.",1640298381.0
3487,"PSA: In America, We Realize Your Losses, but in Degeneria Your Losses Will Realize YOU!",rn71pu,"For those of you who have net realized losses, you may leave and ignore this post.

For those of you who are a whole other level of degenerate and trade options in your retirement accounts, you also can leave and ignore this post.

**For the remaining 3% of you, who realized net gains in a taxable account, you really need to pay attention so that you aren't in a world of hurt.**

Every year around March or April, someone becomes absolutely mystified that, yes, they owe taxes on all of their gains (WOW!). This scenario especially common here due to something called 'beginners luck', in which you make sick gains but have absolutely idea what you are doing.

And, that means that if you made money late in this year, and then didn't set money aside for tax or realize losers at the end of the year, and then in typical WSB fashion ran your portfolio to zero afterwards, **you could really be unable to pay your taxes and have IRS collections on you!** I've made a helpful clown meme to illustrate how this might transpire:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9l45w0ybd781.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=956b61252c23f7261eef2e24dd71d514ce9d0893

So what's happening here?

When you sell stock at a gain, you will owe tax on it, generally the following year (sometimes sooner). If you are running your portfolio down after, and you don't realize your losers the same calendar year, you still owe full tax on those gains, and you in turn, won't be able to realize those losses. Realizing those losses in the following year leaves you in a scenario where you have a loss shield, but owe tax, and might even have more tax due than you have funds.

So, my PSA is three simple ideas.

1. REALIZE YOUR LOSERS. No, <large cap meme stock) is not going to 4x in the next month, you'll be OK. You can always buy in 32 days later.
2. About that. It's called wash sale. I've put it in the FAQ.
3. If you dont have losses, but you realized substantial gains you may still want to set aside money for your taxes, or just pay them now so you aren't tempted.

**FAQ:**

Q: Wash sale? WTF is that?

A: When you sell a security at a loss, then buy the same security back in 31 days or less, it's a ""Wash sale"", and the loss is disallowed. You don't ""lose"" the loss, it goes back into your acquisition cost (cost basis) of the security.  But, it doesn't shield you on taxes!  So, if you sell to take losses, you gotta wait 31 days.

&#x200B;

Q: Look at me, I'm clever! Can I just buy call options after I sell a loser and avoid a wash sale?

A: Grey area. Don't try that one at home, may want to ask CPA. IRS has been kind of ambiguous on this one. I personally try not to. I have heard some brokers flag this and some do not. I have no idea which do or do not.

&#x200B;

Q:Fine, how much do I set aside?

A: Go calculate your tax rate, but your net gains (gains minus losses and then also minus any losses you had in surplus on last years taxes) times 40% is going to cover you in MOST situations. go 50% if you are in a very high tax state and make a lot of money. But go calculate if you aren't sure.

&#x200B;

Q: I'm not in the US and I'm not a US citizen, how does this work?

A: No idea. Ask google.

&#x200B;

Q: Why should I care? Why not just pay the tax?

A: Because if you can defer the tax by realizing losses, you have more money to invest (or gamble). It's kind of like a 0% margin loan from the government. Also, if the taxes are more than your funds you have a bigger problem. The IRS does not really love to hear ""i'm a little bit poor right now and can't pay"" as an answer.",1640298353.0

Cerence Inc.

CRNC- $78.10

Market cap- $3.01 B 

Cerence Inc., (CRNC $72.52) is the market leading provider of embedded voice-powered assistance and artificial intelligence (AI) software for automotive manufacturers worldwide. CRNC enables drivers to use their voice to control internal features in the car such as using the cars navigation system, infotainment systems, and connect to the outside internet via cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft bringing the ability to use third party external services such as sending a text, making a phone call, making a reservation through Open Table or getting a weather update. This is all through voice activated artificial intelligence capability provided by CRNC.  Car OEMs around the world can use CRNC's platform for both voice activated control of internal systems in the automobile and connecting to outside third party service providers via the cloud. Enabling a true connected car to be realized.  CRNC has around 53% market share of the cars with voice activated internal control systems and around 13-15% market share of cars with connected capabilities.

We feel the street's reaction to CRNC's results and outlook were overly negative and this is a case of a good company with a lower than expected outlook getting taken out to the woodshed and beaten.  The stock dropped over 20% the day the company reported September quarter results and has continued to drop in the week since the report and is down around 33% since reporting Q4FY2021 results on November 22nd.  However, we believe this is an opportunity to Buy the stock at a much lower price point with a move back to the $125 level over the next few quarters as automotive production increases as the supply chain of semiconductors or integrated circuits (ICs) improves.  We believe automotive production is bottoming as we speak and will start to get better in 1-2 quarters. And as this happens we believe CRNC's stock will start to move higher over the next few months and we would be adding to positions at current valuations for a move back up above $125. 

CRNC gets paid several different ways from automotive OEMs with the biggest being licensing revenue for the embedded voice activated software shipped with each new car produced which controls the cars internal systems such as stereo, navigation and control systems of the car.  The company typically gets a one-time up front licensing fee for each car shipped with CRNC's embedded software installed that totals on average $4.00-$5.00 per car (more for premium models and less for entry level cars).  This revenue is recognized in a lump sum when the car ships with CRNC's embedded software installed.  CRNC has around 53-58% market share of cars that ship with some form of embedded control systems (73% of cars have voice activated software and CRNC has 80% share of the 73%). with competition coming from I-Fly Technology in China and a US company called Soundhound.

The company also offers voice activated connectivity solutions allowing CRNC to offer drivers to access outside services via the cloud such as checking the weather, making dinner reservations, searching for a gas station or making a phone call all activated by voice hands free.  CRNC generates revenue when cars are produced using the company's voice activated connectivity solutions versus if the user or driver of the car actually uses the connectivity solutions.  This revenue stream equates to around $1.00-$1.50 per car per year for the length of the contract.  Revenue is received up front for the life of the contract and is amortized over the period of the contract in equal amounts each year generating a large deferred revenue balance and great quarterly predictability as over 80% of revenue each quarter comes from recurring revenue streams.  The competition in this segment is mainly internally produced solutions from the automotive OEMs so we feel more OEMs will outsource this capability in the future to people focused on this market with a broader product line such as CRNC.

In addition, CRNC has around a $2 billion backlog of design wins with key automotive OEMs worldwide for cars that have yet to come into production creating an even more predictable future revenue stream if the cars move into production with the company's embedded voice activated software or its connectivity software solutions.  We would expect this total backlog to take another huge jump higher over the next couple of quarters as one of CRNC's European automotive customers is expected to use CRNC's embedded solutions in a wider swath of its cars and brands generating another order that could be worth more than $100 million. CRNC had two orders in FY2020 that added up to over $230 million worth of orders and backlog from the same European automotive customer and total orders in FY2020 added up to over $835 million again suggesting the company's huge backlog of orders should provide strong revenue visibility and predictable results once automotive production normalizes.

CRNC collects up front licensing revenue when a car is produced using its connectivity solutions versus the user actually using the services.  This is one of the key issues on the September quarter conference call that caused investors to be nervous and the stock to drop over 20% as when this revenue source dropped sequentially many investors took this as a sign CRNC was seeing less usage per car of its connected services which is not the case.  CRNC gets paid if the car is produced using CRNC's connectivity solutions, and not how much each driver actually uses the services, so this revenue source dropped sequentially because of lower auto production levels caused by chip shortages and some one-time spikes in this revenue line item in the June quarter making the sequential comparisons difficult.

Another reason the stock got smacked down after the conference call is investors are now more skeptical with the company's FY2024 revenue target of $600 million given the slow growth environment CRNC is currently facing driven by anemic level of current automotive production.  If growth is projected to be in the 9-16% range for FY2022 to $400-$425 million (which was below the street's initial estimate of $440) this suggests growth must accelerate to 30%+ in FY2023 and FY2024 to hit the longer-term target of $600 million in FY2024.

We believe growth will accelerate for CRNC as overall automotive production improves as IC chip shortages slowly subside during 2022 and into 2023.  Increased levels of total production, increasing market share with key auto OEMs for its core voice activated embedded control software, further penetration into connected services with multiple new and current customers, new connected service offerings and new product introductions for new markets such as ATVs, trucks, and elevators should drive the growth required to hit the $600 million revenue target by FY2024.  Having around a $2 billion backlog and a large deferred revenue balance and 81% of total revenue coming from recurring revenue sources helps with the predictability and visibility into future revenue and EPS growth giving us confidence revenue growth will accelerate. We are convinced auto production is or has bottomed recently and will grind slowly higher over the next few quarters.  As investors see the increase in overall auto production CRNC's stock will start to move higher and when overall production gets back to normalized levels the stock should move back above $125.

After hours yesterday $NVAX [released incredible data](https://ir.novavax.com/2021-12-22-Novavax-Announces-Initial-Omicron-Cross-Reactivity-Data-from-COVID-19-Vaccine-Booster-and-Adolescent-Studies) showing a high degree of antibodies effective against Omicron and Delta. 

This week they have [recommendations from the EU](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-recommends-nuvaxovid-authorisation-eu) and [approval from the WHO.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/who-approves-novavax-vaccine-for-emergency-use-against-covid-19-1.5711623) UK and Canada approvals are coming any day now, and US FDA filing “within days”. After the WHO news, the price spiked to $237. As I write this it's currently at $173.

The vaccine is going to be the top choice in the developing world. It doesn't need super cold freezing, [normal refrigeration works fine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00991-8) - meaning distribution is much more logistically sound than for the $MRNA or $PFE.

The share price right now is a blistering steal having been easily manipulated downward by short hedge funds due to it's low [75 million share float](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVAX/key-statistics/)

Analysis over on r/NVAX shows that short sellers are [shorting biotech ETFs containing $NVAX such as IBB](https://old.reddit.com/r/NVAX/comments/rmdu3r/etf_shorting_of_nvax_stock/) and then routing 80% of shorts to lit exchange to encourage paper hands and shake out retail. 

As soon as NVAX submits to the FDA, you'll start seeing a shitload of global press coverage. Stock is almost completely de-risked from a global manufacturing perspective and now has western approvals and has hard data that it is safer and more effective than others. LEAPS and April calls are at insane prices right now. This stock only has a $16 billion market cap right now, which is less than projected 2022 revenue. This is truly an insane price point.

Also - if you get in now, you get a chance to profit off of some more short-selling assholes who are cynically preying on a company - whose product will literally save millions of lives.

My position: [I'm almost all-in](https://i.imgur.com/PPb4sYt.jpeg). I've bought in for an average of $159ish

(disclaimer: I have a smaller investment in an RRSP that's mostly conservative growth mutual funds, but almost my entire trading fund - about 2/3rds my net worth - is in NVAX right now. This is a big play for me.

3788,"FDA Pfizer, US Army COVID vaccine, Manchin Counteroffer, Market Analysis",rmxwm5,"Hello everyone again!

1. The FDA has approved Pfizer's pill! [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/22/health/pfizer-antiviral-pill-authorized/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/22/health/pfizer-antiviral-pill-authorized/index.html) Sadly it costs $500 for a course to the US government (I think the US ordered 10M (ie $5B USD). Didn't Pfizer say it would make the IP public for all?
2. The US Army has made a vaccine where 24 pieces of the SARS virus was ""stitched"" together. This means all forms of mutated versions of SARS (SARS-COV2, Omicron, Delta, ??? etc) will most likely all be protected against, unless if my sheer chance all 24 parts mutate (ie 1/24 \* 1/23 \* 1/22 \* ... \* 1/1 == 1/24! = a 1 in 10 with 22 zeros chance). [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/12/22/armys-vaccine-could-protect-against-all-coronavirus-variants/?sh=3470aa7d2eec](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/12/22/armys-vaccine-could-protect-against-all-coronavirus-variants/?sh=3470aa7d2eec)
3. Interestingly Manchin (D) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/12/20/manchin-biden-child-tax-credit/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/12/20/manchin-biden-child-tax-credit/) counteroffered a $1.8T package excluding the child tax credit.
4. The treasury yields have somewhat recovered, which is a reassuring sign. Likewise the put/call ratio from CBOE has reduced drastically to 125 from 160 or so. It's still above 100, so fear is still lingering.

You can see above the treasury yield spread (predictor of recession) was dramatically impacted after WHO - in fact from the bond data, it seems like **Omicron was the main concern of the recent** market correction, and the Federal Reserve and other issues are just small blips.

The high high put/call ratio on inflation day (2x more puts) recovered after inflation was within expectations.

It seems like markets are more ""comfortable"" and ""accomodating"" now. In terms of sectoral analysis:

1. I was shocked to learn Manchin (D) **was actually NOT in favour of the Child Tax Credit**, and in fact seems to **""like"" the climate change deal**? I though news outlets showed he opposed the climate provisions!!! Most likely his dem colleagues leaked his suppos-ed ""counteroffer. This does mean climate change stocks (ie solar panel manufacturers, electric cars etc etc) are still in the game. The media and his constituents are kinda pressuring him to go back to the drawing board.
2. Biden's 500M free testing kits coupled with Pfizer's 89% and Merck's 30% effective pills  + US's new vaccine + Hong Kong Uni's analysis showing 70x more duplication yet 10x less death are paramount for his holiday's travelling and hospitality industry. With the UK showing deaths after going to hospital reduced by 40-50%, and South Africa showing a 80% reduction in hospitalisation chance, it looks like mother nature is being kind to us!

In general, it seems like from the data and with some general analysis, markets are temporarily once again ""back to normal"". It all depends on the put/call data for the next few days, UK's full data release on Omicron, whether Omicron will cause issues for the unvaccinated, and whether Manchin will do anything.

I was still sleeping very well during night when the stock was going down because I did my homework before investing: 1) 5G market is projected to reach $667.90 Billion by 2026. 5G is revolutionary, not evolutionary. 2) Nokia is the only company with an end-to-end 5G platform, 3) I invested in Nokia when Pekka Lundmark was announced as CEO and I saw his plan, which I really liked. Nokia per Pekka Lundmark is leading the 5G patent race with record 3.5K essential patents already filed which means Nokia Technologies will be more profitable going forwards with increased revenues. Nokia increased the R&D to be the market leader (not competitive but a market leader) in Networks. Pekka Lundmark said that they are already the market leader in some parts of the networks business, but they want to catch up and beat competition wherever they are behind. If some businesses perform well, that's good for shareholders. But if some don't and Pekka sells those assets, that’s good for shareholders as well. It's a win-win for the shareholders.",1640259464.0

3991,What's down for fundamental reasons and will bounce back quickly?,rmmczb,"Answer: the stuff people like, but sold because they needed to de-risk

You are looking for big + liquid + widely owned. Earnings were fine/revisions positive. At the very least, the story shouldn't be challenged. Mega-cap internet, select SaaS blow-ups, etc. Hedge fund darlings basically.

What about the stuff that’s down for fundamental reasons, yet should come back quickly?

A lot of this depends on your personal views (if you think oil is about to rip 20% higher, there you go) Right now, I think personally think this bucket includes COVID impacted names… I think people chill out about Omicron sooner rather than later. Pfizer Paxlovid EUA will be a positive catalyst… and should go a long way towards preserving normalcy in the US.

What's down for a fundamental reason, and will take a while to recover?

Large/diverse category here...Some EM's seem to fit this bucket. Brazil is a mess and investors won’t be in a rush to buy the dip until there is more certainty around the 2022 elections. China? While you could get a quick bounce, it will take a while for the China love-hate pendulum to swing back. Not only has the economy slowed, but the geopolitical risk premium has increased. Investors won’t go back to shilling Chinese internet stocks at idea dinners overnight

Some COVID “winners” hitting tough comps also fit here. Most investors won’t rush to buy ahead of decelerating growth. In some cases estimates might need to come down.

And there are plenty of companies where the ""resolution"" will probably take time. Think 2h 2022 / 2023. For instance, ATVI – You know the next few quarters are going to suck. And you also know they will throw the kitchen sink at 2022 (to be fair, probably doesn't go down much). But, unless you expect some corporate action, there aren't many imminent catalysts. Or cable names – they will probably need to show a couple quarters of decent net adds until people chill out about the prospect of fiber overbuilds.

Finally, what about the stuff that’s down for non-fundamental reasons, yet might take a while to come back?

Busted IPO’s / SPACs. Not many PM's say “oh yeah lets re-gross into this name that trades $5m / day with a huge PE overhang and a chart that looks like death.” This isn’t comprehensive. There are a couple groups of companies that straddle these categories.

For instance, “legacy” payments:

Are they down for entirely non-fundamental reasons? No, there are \*some\* competitive developments. But I think the price reaction seems totally disproportionate in many cases. Same with gambling names. Yes, competition in the US Online Sportsbook/iCasino markets remains robust. Yes, you could see additional regulations in the UK. Yes, some markets could face tough comps. But… I think a lot of it is flows. These names are (were?) rather well owned. In these cases, I think ppl want to own these stocks. They just don’t want to do it before 12/31. Worrying about weird price action the last 2 weeks of the year sucks enough as is...

And unless you have a strong value orientation, the price action does not create a sense of urgency. Where you hunt for dislocations is going to be a function of your mandate. A pod probably isn't going to invest based on 2023 numbers at a COVID ""winner"". And a large LO probably isn't going to play for a quick bounce in xyz china ADR etc.",1640230107.0

4043,"Fancy Tax Tips and Tricks thread: How to keep the filthy feds off your cold hard tendies this tax season in easy to read list format (please read if you have made or lost money trading this year, I might save you some cash)",rmkay6,"Sup Idiots, just got off the phone with my CPA and I want to pass on to you all of the fun things you can do with your money in the next few days to pay as little tax as possible. A lot of this stuff is unique to people who suddenly earn A LOT more money than they normally make through trading.  I'm making a list, you fuckers can check it twice, and any good comments with more information will be added.  

[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ&ab_channel=MBtits)]

1. Give money to charity.  But make sure its a legit charity and get your receipts.  This is an unlimited deduction.

1.  Try to hold off on realizing any large capital gains before the end of the year.

2. Close out any big losing positions before the new year, AND do not re-open them for 1 month (or a similiar position) or you'll trigger a wash sale and it doesn't count.

3.  Pay 25,000 towards your mortgage in a payment marked for interest only (max deduction you can take, has to be towards your primary residence).

4.  Take depreciation against any rental properties you own.  Goes in the same pool of deductions as tip 4 so no more than 25k total.

5.  If you normally don't make a lot of money every year, the IRS is expecting the same dismal amount of tax from you in April.  As long as you have withheld a similiar amount of money from your paychecks this year, they won't charge you for holding the big bag you've ammassed this year if you have somehow hit it big.

7.  If you or anyone you claim as a dependant is a student a surprising amount of stuff can be written off.

6. **ULTRA RETARDED TIP** You can file for a tax extension and continue to trade using your new found tendies for an additional 6 months until OCTOBER 15th.  The Catch?  You have to pay .5% fee on the money you should have paid them on APRIL 15th.  Also if you lose all the money that you owed them, guess what? You still owe them.

7.  Take previous year's capital loss carry over and apply it to this years capital gains.  The limit of 3k capital loss perpetual carry over only applies if you are deducting capital losses vs normal income.  If you have gains this year, but losses from previous years you can apply their deduction fully to this year.

8.  There is NO SUCH THING as getting bumped up into the next tax bracket.  The US works on a progressive tax system, so even first $9,950 that Jeff Bezos made this year was taxed at 10% which is the same amount that you got taxed on the first $9,950 you made working at Wendy's.

9.  DO NOT get shiesty trying to claim office furniture and shit as a home office expense.   That is the #1 way to get audited.  There are a shit-ton of rules surrounding it and unless you are actually self-employed and work from home its really hard to claim things properly.

Thats all I can think of now.  Like I said feel free to add or debate me on any item of this list.

4052,Hedge fund shorts HUBS and attempts to sway public opinion with BS twitter post - DD Rebuttal,rmk2a4,"# [Kerrisdale Capital](https://twitter.com/KerrisdaleCap) exclaims that they're short $HUBS and the reasoning behind it. Their post is BS. Here's a breakdown:

&#x200B;

>""HUBS"" benefited from a ""one time covid boost""

***Really?*** They didn't listen to the last earnings call.

* **HUBS's retention rate is at an all time high and still increasing**
* This is due to improvements in their product, not some one-time covid boost.
* HUBS put all their resources into improving existing features rather than building new ones for **an entire calendar year** a couple years ago, setting themselves up for better retention
   * This aligned perfectly for them with the pandemic; loads of new customers all with their new very high retention rate
* The other implication here that brick-and-mortar businesses that went online last year will now remove their digital presence is ridiculous

&#x200B;

>HubSpot’s growth decelerated for years prior to Covid

This is uninformed at best and misleading at worst.

* As stated previously, HUBS intentionally didn't release any new features in the year leading up to the pandemic to work on fixing bugs and improving customer happiness with existing features 
* Even so, this was a minor deceleration, **and they're talking about growth rate not growth**

&#x200B;

> Online reviews are blah, products are flawed, pricing is expensive 

Some quick googling shows this is **complete BS**. 

* Great customer reviews. 
* Pricing innovation with free CRM tiers.
* If you google ""I switched from salesforce to""... ""hubspot"" is the only auto-complete in the category (excel and outlook dont apply)

&#x200B;

> Competition is intense and growing rapidly. 

They then mention Salesforce. This is the **exact opposite** of what's happening. 

* HUBS is taking Salesforce customers not the other way around. 
* Salesforce does not capture the small business market like HUBS does. 

&#x200B;

>No wonder leadership is leaving & dumping shares. Founder/CEO Brian Halligan handed reins to new CEO Yamini Rangan 

**Yet again, complete BS**. 

* Brian Halligan is still on as executive chair
* Probably wanted a break from CEO after his vehicle accident
* Leadership Isn't ""dumping shares"" they are executing normal timed sells which ANY company does.

&#x200B;

**As you can see, this is a pretty laughable attempt at PR to profit from their bad position.** With the HUBS earnings call around the corner, and their string of great results, there is absolutely no reason why we wont get a big win quarter (and 2021 year) yet again.

At least the replies in twitter seem to be digging into them for their BS. HUBS has a very low % of retail investors currently. Get on that before it shoots over 1000 retards.",1640222871.0

Even if the fundamentals are golden, why trade these stocks when the public is just going to keep pushing big tech P/E higher? Microsoft has risen 50% YTD despite sup-par earnings and SITS AT A P / E OF 36.6. Apple keeps rising (30.8 P to E) but can they really keep increasing the prices of their products even higher? Do you guys think that big tech p to e will just keep shooting up despite meh earnings like it has in the past 3 years? Keep in mind Microsoft p to e in 2019 was just 25.5 and Apples was around ONLY 16. What is really interesting is that these P/E were stagnant from 2010 to 2018 but for some reason the market just blew up the price earnings of many companies around the start of 2018. This is Walmart for example. See how P/E was normal for years until suddenly 2018? My theory is that many people in the market are new investors so they don't care about P/E and just dump their money into index funds or companies they think are doing well like Walmart. This is making it harder for investors to properly gage the market for good picks because it doesn't even matter how these companies do, they just go up anyways.

4140,Bull Market Incoming,rmg9pr,"Omicron:

The Covid-19 Omicron variant has been identified in every US state, as well as in Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, according to public statements from hospital systems and state officials in their respective states.

South Africa has reported data on Covid cases driven by the Omicron variant that appears to give added impetus to claims the country is experiencing a lower severity of disease.
·        “In South Africa, this is the epidemiology: Omicron is behaving in a way that is less severe,” said Prof Cheryl Cohen of the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), one of the authors of the study.
·        “Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other variants,” she said during a news conference by a group 
of NICD scientists on Wednesday.

Fully vaccinated people infected with the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus could end up with super immunity to the coronavirus, according to new research from Oregon Health & Science University.
* The research — published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association — found that breakthrough infections create “a robust immune response against the delta variant.”
* Researchers said the findings indicate that “the immune response is likely to be highly effective against other variants as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate.”
Dr. Marcel Curlin, associate professor of medicine (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine, said this is likely the endgame for COVID-19.
* “I think this speaks to an eventual endgame,” Curlin said. “It doesn’t mean we’re at the end of the pandemic, but it points to where we’re likely to land: Once you’re vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, you’re probably going to be reasonably well-protected from future variants. Our study implies that the long-term outcome is going to be a tapering-off of the severity of the worldwide epidemic.”



Bottlenecks and supply chain ease:

Supply chain disruptions made getting enough products to meet high demand difficult this year.
* Lowe’s placed larger orders with suppliers earlier than usual ahead of the holidays, as retailers scramble to confront supply chain bottlenecks prior to the busy shopping season.
Inventory levels are ""actually getting better, not worse,"" according to experts
“One of many companies that has adapted its supply chain, Lowes made a $1.7 billion supply chain overhaul, and deepend its relationship with suppliers and has largely avoided major shortages by increasing lead times for the most part,”
“Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during an August earnings call that the electronics retailer is well positioned for the holiday season after moving strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the second quarter. Macy’s is also confirming orders with vendors much earlier than usual”
“The cost of shipping may remain elevated next year, but capacity is set to increase as global orders for new container ships hit record highs”

“The rapidly growing new transportation capacity orders … should turn operational towards the end of 2022, which should significantly ease shipping bottlenecks,”



Consumer remains strong:

“The Consumer Confidence Survey® reflects prevailing business conditions and likely developments for the months ahead. This monthly report details consumer attitudes, buying intentions, vacation plans and consumer expectations for inflation, stock prices and interest rates. Data are data available by age, income, 9 regions and top 8 states”
“Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.”
“Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.



Fed will be less aggressive on inflation:

In response to better supply chains and decelerating inflation, the Fed will not hike rates 3 times next year and the quantitative easing wont affect much of anything in the market. One to two hikes seems more probable and some of the best returns in the stock market come during rate hiking cycles,
“The Federal Reserve’s more aggressive plans outlined on Wednesday to rein in worrying inflation levels aren’t expected to soon drain extreme levels of liquidity from financial markets”
“Overall, strong economic growth, labor market recovery and elevated inflation clearly have moved the Fed toward an accelerated focus on shifting policy and particularly in getting quantitative easing over with BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in emailed comments about the Fed’s pivot”",1640211406.0

The stock is not expected to have any catalysts in the next few weeks, hence options on it are relatively cheap. January 21 $25 calls have an IV of about 51% right now. 

I think there's a possible catalyst in the next 2 weeks that could cause the stock to go up and the option chain IV to increase substantially as a result. As we head into the holidays, people will have more free time and talk about stocks. CRSR bagholders will talk about their bags with family and friends and might get some people to buy into the company. Traders will be looking around for trade ideas and CRSR will be on the list. Everyone that has wanted to sell the stock has already done so, including shortsellers, who have shorted 33% of the float. If CRSR starts to go up a bit, it might create a positive feedback loop causing various groups to buy the stock. As the stock goes up, more people hear about it on social media and through friends, buy into it, and have it go up more. Rinse and repeat. The squeeze narrative might start doing the rounds again. The stock has little downside in the next couple weeks and a small chance of a large upside. 

To capitalize on the above, I think buying OTM options gives the potential of a asymmetric play. If the stock goes up, you will benefit from both increased IV and the value gained from the stock going up. If it doesn't go up, your calls will bleed but a significant IV crunch is unlikely. IV is up a bit today and buying calls a few days ago would have been nice but I think there's still lots of room left to profit.

AAL said on Wednesday it was seeking shareholder approval for a rights offering plan to avert any hostile takeovers and preserve a $16.5 billion tax benefit, as the industry grapples with the Omicron coronavirus variant.

The No. 1 U.S. airline said it had cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards exceeding $16.5 billion which would be at risk if there is a change in ownership.

In January this year, the company had reported a record annual loss of $8.9 billion due to pandemic-induced restrictions and lockdowns.

The airline said it has adopted a tax benefit preservation plan to aid the carrier in reducing its future federal income tax expense.

Under the plan, American will issue one preferred stock purchase right in the form of a dividend for each outstanding share of American Airlines.

The dividend will be payable on January 5, 2022, the company said, adding that these rights can be exercised by the shareholders only if a person or group acquires a stake of 4.9% or more without the board's consent.

The rights, if approved, will let the shareholder buy the stock of the world's biggest airline at a 50% discount rate.

The airline said the rights will expire on December 20, 2022 if there is no shareholder approval. Otherwise, they will expire in December 2024.",1640192458.0

4342,GDP 3rd estimate better than expected (2.3 v 2.1) + FDA Pill Approvals + COVID + BBB + Tesla,rm8k7e,"Hello everyone! You might remember me reporting my [predictions for inflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation_countdown_10_minutes_830_et_my_guess) (6.8 actual my guess 6.7 to 6.9) and the [Federal Reserve's decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgx1qg/federal_reserve_day_my_predictions_on_powells/) (2x taper, 3 rate hikes, talk about Omicron).

1. US's GDP Growth 3rd estimate was better than expected!! (2.3% vs 2.1%) [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth). Now the final quarterly GDP growth on January 27 is super important - most likely though from data from retail sales, etc, it's very possible the public just bats an eye to Omicron.
2. FDA presumably might approve Pfizer and Merck by the end of the week! (maybe eeven TODAY???) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/fda-approve-paxlovid-molnupiravir-covid-pills](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/fda-approve-paxlovid-molnupiravir-covid-pills)
3. UK recently declined adding lockdowns on Tuesday. Deaths and hospitalizations still seem to not have spiked (yet). Australia likewise also declined using lockdowns today.
4. BBB (build back better) seems to be in motion (again) even though Manchin (D) doesn't like it. For eg, the Coal Union in Manchin's own state is not happy with Manchin. Mitt Romney (R) and Josh Hawley (R) seems to also like the child tax credit as an idea, albeit they probably want some sort of tax deduction of some sort.
5. [https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/22/looks-like-elon-musk-is-done-selling-tesla-stock-for-now](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/22/looks-like-elon-musk-is-done-selling-tesla-stock-for-now) Elon seems to suggest his 10% selling as per the Twitter poll has now been completed?

The question now is will this barage of somewhat happier news cause markets to finally escape the current valley of confusion? (people said tech was good - it increased, then down. People said banking was good - it increased, then went down. Utilities and staples were good - it increased, then went down etc etc etc - a death spiral).

4412,Blackberry Beat Earnings and earnings analysis(The Good the bad and the misunderstood),rm6e8y,"After taking a strong run yesterday up 4% Blackberry is trading 3% down after earnings.

**The Good: Complete earnings beat**  


* **Non-GAAP EPS**: US$0.00 (beat by US$0.07) last quarter they beat earnings by a mere. 01 and the stock surged.
* **GAAP EPS**: - US$0.05 (beat by US$0.11)
* **Revenue:** US$184m (beat by US$7.42)

**The Bad: Revenue Growth -17% Y/Y** 

Topline this number looks bad, many big tech names have Y/Y sales trending downwards, but for a growth company, this is simply a miss.  **The stock initially popped after hours on earnings beat, but then dropped on this information alone.** 

**The misunderstood:** 

Blackberry is at a transition point as a company moving away from its business of old to becoming more of a cybersecurity firm and automative software play. Guidance showed that cybersecurity is going to be its largest revenue source moving forward, but what's not discussed enough is its penetration into the automotive industry  


In the past month, BMW and M&M both announced agreements to use Blackberry's QNX technology in their vehicles.  They are now involved with 45 automotive companies and over 195 vehicles worldwide. **195 million vehicles worldwide?!?!** They are cornering the market and nobody seems to love the potential here! VW and Toyota both sell about 10 million cars a year, and yet that's nothing compared to their market penetrations

Furthermore, they have 707 million on cash on hand, and for a company valued at less than 5 bullion that is unheard of. They have the cash to execute their vision and the numbers to dominate the cybersecurity vehicle market.

This isn't a BB to the Moon DD, god knows we don't need another one of those. This is trying to get a grasp of earnings and an understanding of where the companies future lies

In 2021, The Ark Innovation ETF is -21.11% YTD, The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF is down 32% YTD, and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF is down 21% YTD. The one ARK ETF in the green is their Autonomous Tech& Robotics ETF, which is up about 8% YTD.


The ARK Innovation ETF ($ARKK) is the best play with regards to getting your best bet on a solid return. The top stocks encompassing the ETF are Tesla, Roku, Teladoc, Square, Zoom, Shopify, Coinbase, and Twilio, amassing nearly 50% of its value.

4640,Tracking CNBC Option Action Recommendation 2021 Profitability Results,rltcn0,"Have you ever wondered how good the CNBC celebrity investment pundits perform on option trades? Are the experts better than just investing in a market index fund?

Over the last year, I've monitored every one of the CNBC Option Action recommended trades and discovered that on an overall basis, Melissa Lee, Mike Khouw, Carter Braxton Worth, and Tony Zhang did pretty well.

* Total 2021 Options Action trades - 117 of which 39% were profitable (excludes high risk trades)
* Total profit for the year 13% (but holding period is only 64 calendar days), so you can multiply profits throughout the year
* My Favorite trade of the year - June 4, 2021 Option Action show:
   * Sell AMC $65 straddle for $69 when stock price closed at $47.91 yielding a 633% profit in two weeks. This was during the meme stock mania.
* Best recent trade on CNBC Options Action trade
   * The October 15, 2021 show recommended to Buy a Call Butterfly expiring November 19th at $650/$680/$710 strikes for Netflix -NFLX
   * The net cost of the option was only $4.30 or for a single contract $430.
   * The stock closed at $678.80 on November 19, 2021 yielding a profit of 572%
* Best month of the year was November 2021 where there were 10 trades expiring, seven of which were profitable yielding a monthly gain of 127%.
* Worst month of the year was August 2021 where there were 9 trades expiring, eight of which lost money with a monthly loss of 41%.
* If one started in January, trading every one of the option recommendations, there was never a time where your original capital went negative. This is partially due to a great start in January 2021 with a 112% gain.

At least for 2021, the CNBC Option Action pundits did a pretty good job. Hopefully, this trend will continue into the future.",1640135902.0

4654,Opportunity: Low Retail Volume + High Short Interest,rlskpm,"This setup with stocks that have low retail volume/interest + high short interest has the potential to be explosive. Let me explain.

I was watching a meet Kevin video (I know I'm a dumbass) and he brought up some data that he found with one of his expensive resources that is commonly used with big banks and hedge funds. Essentially, these institutions, since the gamester fiasco, pay extreme attention towards retail volume on stocks they're shorting. The examples that Kevin brought up were Corsair, Shift, and Lemonade. With these names, it appears that when retail begins buying the dips and pouring in, hedge funds quickly close their short positions in an attempt to minimize their losses or take profits, then, when retail interest dies down, they pile on with their shorts again.

I found this very intriguing as I believe it presents an extremely large opportunity. First, just the sight of a few retail investors pouring into stocks like this will cause these institutions to RAPIDLY close their short positions, the actual price movement may not even be that significant but when they observe data displaying a surge in retail volume, they will flee for the hills. Additionally, institutions at this time of year are looking to close short positions on stocks like CRSR, Shift, and LMND because they're already up a significant amount, the year is coming to an end, and they may be anticipating a Santa clause rally .

All of these factors lead me to believe that names with low retail volume and high short interest are extremely large opportunities at this moment. I personally like CRSR as it seems they have the best fundamentals compared to other names that fit this criteria but there may also be other opportunities out there.

What do ya'll think?

Is this strategy viable?

What are some other names that fall under this criteria?

**Additionally, I do not endorse any of these names, mods please do not take down my post, I put in genuine effort and I'm not trying to pump anything, just spreading a kinda cool strategy**",1640133514.0

4666,SPY to the Moon,rlrvlf,"**Prediction Feb 18th:** $535-540 \*not financial advice\*

**Postions: Attached**

&#x200B;

Looking at the chart you will notice SPY has been trading flat for around 50 days. SPY has never done this before (rare). Very heavy price consolidation = breakout soon

During an uptrend, the RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, and the indicator frequently hits 30 or under.

&#x200B;

The recent sell-off/loss momentum in trend in my opinion was because of Evergrande/Debt Ceiling/No Stimmy, just overall a dried-up economy. Every earnings shit the bed, I hated my life being a perma-bull. Then I noticed how in the world is SPY trading flat for legit 2 months? SPY has never done this before. So I did some research and noticed the following. This new covid variant is a literal covid bull run again. Our gov won't let the economy crash when the ICU at hospitals are filling up faster than they have ever before.

&#x200B;

**No taper + Rate hikes + Stimmy (Look at EU data excluding England, they are retarded)**

&#x200B;

There is a literal ladder attack on SPY. Mofos keeping it under ATH so they profit shorting. Looking at the data you will notice this major bull flag with Biden's Build Back Better bill about to pass.

&#x200B;

**Failed to Deliver**

Date: 11/30

SPY Price: $464.60

The number of shares: 4,735,862

Value of shares in USD: $2,200,281,485.20

[https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc](https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc)

&#x200B;

You read that correct, legit $2.2 BILLION in shares have been failed to deliver. So it is under my assumption when Dems use reconciliation (pass BBB) without intervention this short will want to buy shares NOT at a higher price compared to what they shorted (since the low probability of SPY being stuck between $450-$473 again).

&#x200B;

This means SPY will likely gamma once it's greater than $464.60. Look at the IV of 12/31 deep OTM calls and you will understand why they aren't worthless. In order for this to happen people must buy shares and hold (likely based on SPY price consolidation).

&#x200B;

**Probability**

Very high in my opinion. 10 million in buy orders on no news yesterday, 2 million buy orders today at the close of the trading day, and an options trader bet $65 million on deep OTM calls exp before x mas. Who would do this without knowing anything? Probably Pelosi IMO.

With its user-friendly smart algorithm, touch screen, and computer-vision system, Cust2Mate streamlines the retail shopping experience by automatically scanning purchased products and enabling in-cart payment so that customers can simply “pick & go”, and bypass long cashier checkout lines. This results in a more efficient shopping experience for customers, less unused shelf-space and manpower requirements, and advanced command and control capabilities for store managers.

Safe, soundless, and environmentally friendly, A2Z’s highly efficient lightweight Smart Energy Packs employ an advanced technological process in order to produce electricity wherever and whenever it’s needed. Originally developed for the Israeli military and tested under the most rigorous conditions, the Smart Energy Pack has been adapted for multipurpose civilian use, making it suitable for homes, apartments, offices or on-the-go. It’s designed for easy carrying and deployment.

Following the rout yesterday, Global stock markets were on the upswing today and the same was reflected in the US markets. The indices recouped the Monday losses and closed above Friday’s (12/17) close though nothing much has changed in terms of the concerns on the Omicron variant, which is fast becoming the dominant variant throughout the US and the World. Even with the cases rising and restrictions increasing, the general public is in a much better position to handle this new variant; vaccinations and general awareness on masks and social distancing is sure to help this leg of the pandemic to be in the rear-view mirror with much less damage.

Shares of Micron Technology was up by more than 10% following its beat of topline and EPS in its Q1 earnings and the subsequent strong chip demand forecast. The company’s shares have been trading sideways this year but has been attracting lots of attention on its DRAM and NAND Flash storage.

EV Company and pandemic-era favorite Nikola will pay a fine of $125 Mn in settlement with SEC over alleged false claims by Nikola’s ex-CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola neither accepted nor denied the claims of Milton in terms of the settlement. Nikola currently trades above $9 which is a fraction of $70+ it traded in mid-2020s. Hindenburg’s damaging report and the subsequent watered-down deal with GM reversed the tides for this stock.

Another meme stock, WISH, jumped up by more than 14% today. For the year though the ecommerce stock is down by more than 80%.

Airlines and Cruise stocks were all up today with DAL (+5.9%), AAL (+4.7%), UAL (+6.9%), CCL (+8.7%) and RCL (+5.4%) significantly in the green following a positive report by Bank of America. According to the report, domestic bookings have been largely resilient in the face of Omicron thus far with more softness in the international bookings. Cruise stocks continued the momentum on the favorable commentary by the management of CCL yesterday.",1640122493.0

4757,China Omicron Bear Thesis...,rln1wq,"China's method of dealing with COVID is zero tolerance.  It will lockdown an entire city over a few cases. As a result very few Chinese have had any covid -- they're all covid virgins.  Their vaccine provides almost no protection against Omicron infection, and is far less effective against COVID generally as our MRNA vaccines.  The reason for their strict controls is that their own analysis is that their hospitals would be overrun if Covid got out of control.

Now the omicron variant is up to 70x more contagious.  Cramer got it, and then gave it to his co-host while testing negative.  The tests don't pick it up fast enough to stop the spread.  The US headlines say it went from 3% of cases to 73% in this country in just a week.  Hard to believe, but if that's remotely true how can it be stopped?  I doubt no matter how strict China is that they will be able to contain Omicron, and even if they do it will only be due to resorting to extreme lockdowns.

It doesn't matter that Omicron is less fatal, China only known response is zero tolerance lockdowns.  Omicron is like the gate-crasher variant, it may overrun the system with positives, hospitalizations, making it harder to prevent the spread of other variants which China has kept out thus far and which they have no immunity and only a partially effective vaccine against normal COVID.

4854,VCRA - the Boomer Rip: +100% institution holds & low IV hedges,rlj3wv,"This is happening real-time (read: now) so I’m going to get right to the point. 

Vocera (VCRA) provides and sells wireless solutions (software and hardware) to hospitals and various industries. They’re profitable and doing great. More later. 

What you need to know is that shorts are closing for EOY rebalance. This is a huge problem for them as institutions hold so much of the stock that the trading float is literally virtually 0. The liquidity is so bad that even small shorts closing out are spiking all time highs. Meanwhile, calls are very cheap since nobody knows about this boomer stock. Open interest on the Jan exp is effectively 0 and implied vol is only **50%\***. 

https://preview.redd.it/iza3o24fgx681.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acdffef8cda14bb9736c233d18404360b430ce1

As shares and calls are purchased, I am betting on a sustained bleed up of closing shorts, low liquidity, and OTF long term holders who aren’t selling. My aim is far beyond the 70c strike. 

Summary

* **Non-existent float**: The entire float is held by long-term OTF holders who aren’t selling (largest 30 firms own 92% of all shares). This is very important.
* **Short rebalance**: Short shorts are in the process of closing out by EOY rebalance and are spiking the price to ATH.
* **Historical IV has been low while the daily moves are high.** IV is 50%. Calls are cheap for where I believe the price will go. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we’re close to hitting already.
* **Continual upgrades:** Firms are exacerbating the process by issuing upgrades encouraging new longs to buy.

**About**

Vocera (VCRA) offers the leading platforms for workflow and communication. They create and sell both softwares and hardwares to healthcare professionals and many retail service enterprises. They are killing it.

Vocera is deployed in nearly 20% of all U.S. hospitals. Their expanded deployments, while aggressive, have only been matched by further company developments. For example, VCRA’s pivot to software-led enterprise sales was utilized in a Cleveland Clinic expansion in Q3 as one example in their second largest deal ever signed. They have been winning contract after contract flawlessly. 

VCRA delivered a nearly perfect Q3 with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS beating consensus estimates. FY21 was raised for the **3rd** time this year. 

Recent upgrades include:

Dec 20: [Hallum $71 outperform ](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Vocera+Communications+%28VCRA%29+PT+Raised+to+%2471+at+Craig-Hallum/19372456.html?classic=1)

Nov 29: [Sandler $68 overweight](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vcra-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-11-2-3/)

So what, great company? Well firms have been loading up nonstop and now we have yet another fully share-utilized company. 

**Eight Years of +100% Institutional Holdings = null float**

https://preview.redd.it/0iqoq2lggx681.png?width=3167&format=png&auto=webp&s=5094a59c6c4df77b1a54559a567fdbd83a194841

Institutional holdings have shown +100% for 8 consecutive years because so many of the firms are OTF holders who won’t sell. This is very important. The 30 biggest funds hold and have been holding 31.7m shares (**that’s 92% of all outstanding shares**) for years now. They won’t be selling anytime soon. These funds hold for 5, 10, 20 years. I included the share history below. Note that there are no lock-ups expiring. There are no warrants. There is no convertible share trap waiting to explode. It is simply a small float.

https://preview.redd.it/fp6fwjoigx681.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6f6f623552e0560ff1db2fe1833ab0739d018c

I’ll say it again: the largest buyers aren’t selling and leave less than 3m (true number is closer to 0) shares for shorts to purchase to cover their shares.  Lower float = lower liquidity = stronger moves. 

**Rally into EOY**

>“One should note that large short positions likely need to be closed before January, which is likely to see a small-cap, value and cyclical rally… We believe these conditions are not met, and hence this market episode may end up in a short and cyclical rally into year-end and January.” - [JP Morgan’s Kolanovic](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-picks-advance-while-jpmorgan-205404568.html), Dec 17 2021

As funds rebalance and close out positions before January, the low liquidity environment of VCRA will prompt large losses leading to more shorts covering. 

Shares outstanding: 34.8m (bloomberg)

Institutional shares: 31.7m-34m (bloomberg)

Float: 0-3m shares 

Short interest: 3.5m (FINRA)

Short interest % of float: 100% or greater

https://preview.redd.it/cisd401lgx681.png?width=4430&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b0929a26b32cd4cdd6daa1e2eefd8cf78ee6021

There are no incremental flows to this stock. The fundamental momentum pushing this stock higher is enough to create substantial gains in price due to shorts rebalancing alone. Factor in a gamma and vanna spike due to introducing options, and what results might have some fireworks.

**The contracts are priced with low volatility**

https://preview.redd.it/sgrkgctmgx681.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=d689dcd1245e440b7c685a3ea3c38400f1043cbb

Historical vol is pretty low compared with the large daily moves. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we’re close to hitting already. The spreads are jumping around - some brokers don’t even show the correct numbers. 

Of course IV will increase as calls are purchased, but how the MM will react is unknown whether it is via purchasing shares or hedging volatility via selling other contracts. No contracts are being opened for Feb and beyond today so I’m assuming shares are being hedged.

**Positions**

https://preview.redd.it/04g9cnaogx681.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ad6ba3a63a2d1887cb3e734d4138c65f618084

\+ others and shares. This is a slow bleed up. My aim is to hold these through the 31st though moves can be quick and sudden in the near term.

Cheers

4861,Is the market missing the pending Terminix Acquisition,rlitja,"TLDR: Selling for \~$45 being acquired for $55 in 6 to 12 months.

Rentokill announced they are acquiring Terminix.

From the Document:

Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (“ADSs”), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash. Based on Rentokil Initial’s 5-day average daily volume weighted share price and the 5-day average of the SterlingUS Dollar exchange rate both over the period spanning 6 to 10 December 2021 inclusive, this values the entire share capital of Terminix at US$6.7billion, **implying a value of US$55.00 per share of Terminix common stock**, and represents an aggregate consideration mix of 80% stock and 20% cash and(**Emphasis added**)

[https://s26.q4cdn.com/370286142/files/doc\_news/2021/12/Rentokil-Initial-Acquisition-of-Terminix-RNS-141221-FINAL.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/370286142/files/doc_news/2021/12/Rentokil-Initial-Acquisition-of-Terminix-RNS-141221-FINAL.pdf)

Currently TMX is trading for \~$45 with the deal expected to close in 2nd half of 2022 at the above $55. That means in \~6 to 12 months the stock should appreciate by 22%. or annualized 44% to 22% respectively.

Does this mean the market is assuming the deal will not close or is the market missing something? It seems too obvious?

Disclosure: Long TMX

edit: Estimated Deal Value  
 **For the ADRs**  
It says 128,660,000 shares of RentoKill ADRs which closed $39.49 = $5.08 billion  
\+ cash of $1.3 billion = 6.380 billion / 121.1489 million TMX shares = **$52.67** per share

From Document: Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (“ADSs”), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash.

**or for the English shares**  
584.80 in pounds \* 0.0132 USD/GBX = $7.73 price in USD of english shares  
5.3094 english shares to TMX shareholder \* $7.73 = $41.05

\+11.00 in cash for TMX shareholders = **$52.05**

From Document:  
The cash election consideration and the stock election consideration will be equalized to the value of the aggregate consideration per Terminix share, as measured by the value of 5.3094 new Rentokil Initial shares and $11 in cash as of  
the second day prior to closing.

Either way, Im getting about $52 for something selling at 45.08. I don't get why there is an approximate upside of 15% just sitting there.

The sell-off began when Elon Musk’s Twitter poll supported him in selling 10% of his holdings, but the overall market sentiment since then hasn't helped either. The Omicron variant is sparking fear of a return to lockdowns, while last week also saw a hawkish pivot among the major central banks.

However, Tesla remains the leader in the EV space. This is backed up by their impressive financial growth in recent times, and with tech that is still superior to their competitors, they would be expected to continue to dominate the industry for the foreseeable future.

With $TSLA closing today below the key $900 level, it’ll be interesting to see how it shapes up over the coming weeks. Of course, all trading carries risk, but can the stock bounce from here, or are we going to have to wait before it starts another leg higher?",1640044713.0

**Nasdaq: 14,980.94 (-188.74)(-1.24%)**

Omicron and Mr. Manchin’s rejection of Biden’s “Build Back Better” sent the market spiraling down for one of its worst days in the already Bearish December. The crude oil tumbled as well losing 6% midday and closing at 3% in the red. 

WSB’s favorite meme stocks were all in red for most of the day continuing the worsening December trend for the meme/growth stocks. GME was up by almost one percent at the close picking up some momentum at the end though well short on the average volume. AMC, despite opening in green following the bumper opening of Spider Man: No way home, reversed mid-morning and finally closed at 2% on the up. Another favorite of the memes, Palantir, plunged by more than 5% to close almost at its 52 week low.

Pandemic favorites Zoom was in green for most of the day and Chegg finished up at less than one percent, as stay at home and lockdowns were being announced in Europe and seems to be increasingly possible in this side of the Atlantic as well. 

Carnival Cruise Line (CCL) rose today by 3% after the Company said it expects to be profitable in the second half of 2022 despite rising Omicron cases worldwide.

Moderna shares were briefly up as the Pharma company’s booster shots provide better protection against Omicron by increasing the antibodies 37-fold. But along with the rest of the market the company’s shares went down in red and closed 6% down.

Shares of Rocket Companies (Rocket Mortgage’s parent) plunged more than 6% following the acquisition of Finance App TrueBill for $1.28 Bn. This acquisition will help the company to improve upon its image as a FinTech player and not just a mortgage company. Truebill is a finance management application that analyses spending habits, identifies inefficiencies and offers methods to improve financial health. It has 2.5 million members and is expected to add $100 million in annual recurring revenue to Rocket’s $1.3 Billion of annualized servicing fee income.",1640037092.0

5403,OKE STOCK DD,rkupkl,"My background: 10+years of experience in natural Gas

This is not a yolo trade but more of diversification of your portfolio. 

OKE Stock

\-They provide storage, pipeline, consulting work around natural gas. 

\-Gas prices have soared since March 2021.

\-Gas price will soar as Natural Gas is the primary source of generating electricity to our door.

\-Decommissioning of Coal and Nuclear plant will only make more desirable for natural gas to meet the  KW demand we use in the USA.

\-Natural Gas prices are soaring in China and Europer. Currently 5X pricier. It's matter of time once these companies export more natural gas overseas more higher profit. Local domestic suppliers will have to bid higher to compete against oversea suppliers.

\-Renewable is the future answer to replace all this but i dont see a solution for the next 10-20 years.

\-OKE is currently paying 6-7% yield in dividends.

\-Stock price will go up as Natural gas index prices go up.

\-very low float

&#x200B;

Yes. you can trade commodities future but thats one area where i never touch. it's the MOST manipulated market in my opinion. Even if you have insider info, you will get wiped out if someone wants you out of the market.

5484,Letting Children Pick Stocks: Week 16 Update,rksbdc," 

Been a while since my last update. This Omnicron bear market has put both my own and my children's portfolios through the ringer but I still don't think they're doing poorly.

My girlfriend and I started investing for our kids (7 & 1 YO), letting them pick the stocks and invest $10 per week for them.

**7YO Portfolio (mostly in order of purchase): Moderna, Dcoin (can't spell it out on this sub), SPY (x2) SPYG (x2), Square, Paypal, Netflix, Tesla, Coca-Cola, Enphase Energy, McDonalds, Etsy, Chipotle, Gamestop, QQQ**

**Current return: -8%**

The ETFs are my picks as we made the rules that 25% of the portfolio must be ETFs. He seems to be picking stocks with the highest 5Y returns so far. Other times we ask him what companies he likes (chipotle, mcdonalds lol).

**1YO Portfolio we decided to just invest in ETFs until she's a bit older**.

We were rolling dice to pick the page and stock from that page but decided it will be better to just do ETFs until she can actually pick out her own stocks.

**More details:**

My girlfriend has a 7 year old boy and we have a 1YO daughter (almost 2). I put together a list of stocks to pick from (like 200-300 to pick from, ETFs and 10+ of each major market sector). We let them pick or play games to pick. The 1YO ~~rolls dice most the time lol~~ (changed to ETFs for now). We put in $10 every week to whatever they pick. 25% must be in ETFs for some stability.

They'll have access to the money once they're 18, accounts are still in our names just in case, and we don't expect to cash out enough to increase the capital gains taxes. We'll still likely be the gatekeepers for the money so they don't just blow it on hookers; more for a car, college, travel, etc.",1640020981.0

5521,Reddit IPO Valuation,rkra3v,"As you all know, Reddit has begun its process to file for an IPO. As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that.",1640018158.0

5617,EVTL - 2.24M low float with options and short squeeze potential,rkoyii,"**TLDR:** EVTL is a thinly traded float combined with an expanding chain of options. This means that EVTL offers an extremely asymmetric (and volatile) bet with extremely strong gamma squeeze potential.

Vertical Aerospace (NYSE:EVTL) is a[ British electric-aircraft company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90707300/vertical-aerospace-public-spac-nyse) that went public through a SPAC merger last week. In the SPAC trust, 95% of the 30.5m shares were redeemed leaving [**1.57m shares**](https://t.co/KT8iO2XKgO) left. Additionally,[ 10% of sponsor shares are unlocked](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815805/000110465921079856/tm2119323d1_8k.htm) which adds an extra 0.76m shares. There’s no certainty as to when the sponsor will be selling those, however. To stay on the safe side we include those sponsor shares (0.76m) to the float count (1.57m) giving us the 2.24m share float in question - and did I forget to mention - it has options?

**For reference, the last time a stock had a similar float:**

* GWH had a float of 4.2m with options and went to $28.92
* IRNT had a float of 2.8m with options and went to $47.50
* EVTL has a float of 2.24m with options....

**Why do options matter?**

* Total In-The-Money January Open Interest at the time of this posting (After close of day, 12/17, of $12.90) is 2,186 contracts, equivalent to 218,600 shares (9.76% float).
* Total Out-of-The-Money January Open Interest at the time of this posting is 1,542, equivalent to 154,200 shares (6.88% float).

This is important to know because those who write the options will be required to deliver the underlying shares on the in-the-money strikes when it’s time for the options to be exercised. Interestingly, if the open interest on the options are high enough, there could be a situation where the money makers are on the hook for a big portion of the underlying amount of shares available, which will then require an aggressive hedge via shares, thus producing a potential gamma squeeze.

5758,“BBB didn’t pass” will be the bullshit explanation given whether markets rise or fall today.,rkgq8n,"So this is how the stock market “analysts” will explain today’s market behavior…

1. If markets fall: 
“BBB was supposed to unleash usd 2 trillion of expenditure, resulting in an unprecedented surge in economic activity and spending. Manchin’s refusal to support the bill has put that at risk, which is reflected in today’s sell off.”

2. If markets rise: 
“Investors shrugged off the delay in BBB. One of the drivers of today’s rally is the fact that the corporate tax hikes that were bundled with BBB are now delayed by several months. Increased profit expectations from future earnings as a result of this tax “cut” led to investors piling into equities.”

3. If markets are flat:

Ok, so commodities were going up in price due to excess demand and limited supply. But now the global recovery will be slowed due to Omicron. European and Asian countries are already going into lockdown, and banning travel to/from the UK.

With some European countries, like the Netherlands, implementing strict only essentials stores may be open. (I hope we don't bring back the term essential workers). 
The scheduled closure of various facilities are:

- Schools until Jan 9.
- Bars, restaurants, gyms, hairdressers until Jan. 14th
- Wider measures until Jan. 22

I'm sure you're all aware of that Joe Manchin torpedoed the $2T BBB (Build back Better) plan. This could be bullish and decrease aggregate demand. I don't blame him, for saying no, they added too much pork.


Since, the bond yields have gone down, and oil prices have fallen as well. I think this is risk ON!

5773,Building a Moat in Online Gambling – DKNG – DraftKings DD,rkflh9,"**TLDR** – Based on the patents DKNG has and acquired through buying SBtech, they are differentiating themselves from other competitors and able to penetrate new markets, such as The U.S, Australia, Canada and Brazil using live betting.  This feature would be even more popular in a north American market, where there are more pauses in games to actually place a live bet, for example, betting on each pass completion, field goal, or even calls made by refs, in the NFL.

Description

A system and method is provided for enabling an online user to place bets concerning incidents occurring during a game or sports event. This is done by providing a portal for a user to place a bet predicated on a defined incident occurring during a predetermined time segment of the event. The platform includes a module for calculating odds and prize returns for said incident to occur during said sports event or game in response to a user request, a GUI presentation and a settlement engine.

Essentially Pulse Betting allows the operator like DraftKings, to push out live bets with fixed time frames, creating a live casino type adrenaline inducing environment to live sports. This has the potential to be very popular and make sports more exciting for the fans who want to watch with skin in the game.

**Huge implications in the North America**

Mentioned recently by the CTO of DraftKings and shared by CEO Jason Robins, the live betting/in game betting works better in U.S sports because of stoppages. This is widely popular in Europe in sports like soccer already and there are barely any stoppages, when compared to Football and Basketball.

With Canada legalizing sports betting in Ontario and Alberta recently, having a patent like this granted, gives DraftKings a huge advantage over competitors by having a better product mix. This could be their next huge B2C product as well and B2B because they have the backend tech for Pulse Betting established as well.

This stands to be a huge market for North American betting, just based on the magnitude of live betting in Europe and around soccer internationally.

**Implications for DraftKings**

With Pulse Betting secured as a patent or even as a regular product in their mix without a patent, they have grown their product offerings and give users a reason to stick with their app over others. Within a completive environment like sports betting having products like daily fantasy, a marketplace, sports book and Pulse Betting all within the same wallet and app are crucial for gaining market leadership and customer retention.

With DraftKings being vertically integrated, they would be able to provide this tech to other operators as well and increase their B2B business.  So far any Canadian operator would have to go through them for this feature and for countries like Brazil and Australia, this would be a market that is completely untapped by DraftKings at the moment.

5817,Avoid the wash sale rule by utilizing your side piece,rkcogb,"It is the end of the year. Tax season is coming up. A lot of you guys are going to get hit by wash sales in April because you will take losses in December to try to get the tax write off, but then reenter the same position within the 30-day wash sale window. Let me teach you how to dodge wash sales legally.

A ""wash sale"" occurs when you close a stock or option position for a loss, and then reopen the position within the next 30 days, or if you bought more in the 30 days prior to closing for a loss. If you reopen the position like that, then it is called a wash sale and you can't take the deduction until later when you eventually close the position for good. If that occurs in the next tax year, you're screwed this tax season. You've got to avoid wash sales.

Some people try to sell their own positions for a loss, and then open up the same position in their wife's account. That way, they take the deduction but their family still holds the same position by the end of the day. However, this is a wash sale according to the IRS. But here's the key point: **this only applies to legal spouses.**

So if you have 100 shares of GME that you bought at $400 and want to sell for a loss, the trick is to sell now, and realize the deduction. But we don't want to abandon GME for the next 30 days while the wash sale window is open. So instead of ditching completely, use your girlfriend's, your side piece's, your homie's, or your wife's boyfriend's account to reopen that position instead.

**The result: you take your $25,000 tax deduction but still own 100 shares of GME by the end of the day.**

Edit: Yes, you are limited to taking a $3,000 **net** loss for the year. If you made $30,000 and lost $28,000, then you can write off the whole $28k from your $30k gain and just pay taxes on $2k. If you lost more than $3,000 total after deducting from your gains, then you can only deduct $3,000 from your income this year and have to write off the remainder in later years.",1639968190.0
5818,It's time to buy $apps,rkcoe2,"I've been pushing this stock through a strong selloff trend, the waterfall is absent logical reason, other than the stock market being irretional.

Im just gonna state strong buy points instead of forming a 10 pages essay. Also, my English is horrible therefore the less i write the better.

Bullish points.
1. Very strong growth stock that provide great product related to ADs, a niche that's in my opinion is here to stay and grow
2. Not a single earning report has been missed, the company is growing vastly and is yet to show any signs of pacing down.
3. $APPS has fallen from 91 to 43, similarly to last earnings, after of which has climbed to 91 again. No bad news and fundamental have improved, No reason for that cycle to not repeat. Bottom line, the stock is oversold.
4. Earning, management, news and goals are all health.
5. CEO stated the stock will break 1b revenue by 2025, as well as beating the next earning.
6. 75 percent  held by institution, they rose their holding through a fall of 40 percent and held price targets.
7. Insider purchase made by the CEO about 2 week ago at 55, not many shares but a good sign nonetheless.
8. im no expert on technical analysis, but i think it bottomed out

Bearing points:
1. Like all growth stocks they have debt of 275M, i think it's manageable since they got 414m leveragd free cash flow
2. Inflation is a very big provlem to growth stocks because higher debt rate means problems, there's no avoiding it -  you fight inflation by buying a stock that grows faster than it, I think APPS if anything

5887,THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO THIS MALL STORE - JWN Stock,rk8ncs,"**Introduction:**

Today we are going to be talking about Nordstrom (JWN) and are some items to watch out for when looking at this company. Obviously, this company (being a store typically in malls) had one of the biggest impacts on their sales and overall financials. I think that while it can be a turnaround play due to the valuation, it is important to understand their current financial position and where they may go. 

TLDR: I am going to wait a couple of quarters/year to see if this business is truly worth investing in. Currently, I think the business has more downside instead of upside. 

**JWN - Nordstrom:**

“The Company was founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Washington under the guiding principle that success would come by offering customers the very best service, selection, quality, and value. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digitally-connected world by leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private-label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, beauty, accessories, and home goods for women, men, young adults, and children. In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering superior service, product, and experience, including alterations, order pickup, dining, and styling, to make shopping fun, personalized, and convenient.” [2020 10K Filing](https://investor.nordstrom.com/static-files/449f17f6-ffb5-4ec4-8dfe-bf93f16e2822)

Nordstrom operates a higher-end retail fashion store both under Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack where it sells both brand name and private label merchandise. One of the great advantages of having Nordstrom Rack sell at a more affordable price is that they are able to take whatever leftover inventory from the regular Nordstrom stores and finish out their inventory at the Nordstrom Rack. As of Q3 2021, they have three areas that they would like to focus their future opportunities on: “improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing profitability and optimizing our supply chain and inventory flow.” ([Q3 2021 Filing pg. 17](https://investor.nordstrom.com/static-files/31f1f525-cd5f-42ad-b786-569e5db8bdad)) A big portion of their growth opportunities will come from the Nordstrom Rack adoption rate and utilizing digital transformations to optimize their business. They serve customers at 100 full-line stores and 248 Nordstrom Rack locations in 40 U.S. states and Canada; two clearance stores; and five Nordstrom Local service hubs.

**Nordstrom breaks itself down into the following segments:**

* **Nordstrom**
   * This includes Nordstrom.com, TrunkClub.com, Nordstrom-branded U.S. stores, Canada, which includes Nordstrom.ca, Nordstrom Canadian stores, and Nordstrom Rack Canadian stores, and Nordstrom Local
* **Nordstrom Rack**
   * This includes the NordstromRack.com, Nordstrom Rack-branded U.S. stores, Last Chance clearance stores

**Industry**

* According to McKinsey.com, “Travel has traditionally been a key driver of luxury spending, but international tourism is not expected to fully recover until between 2023 and 2024.” Also, the recovery will be uneven between all of the retailers and the ongoing supply chain issues. Many of the companies are having employee retainment issues on both the corporate and retail sides of the business. Now they did note that social shopping and the surge of social media use allows brands to connect to consumers at a more intimate level. McKinsey recommends that companies should double down on integrating the online shops with users' phones and apps in mind so that they build out data to find what their customers want. Lastly, I would like to point out that over the last year and a half we have had a lot of free money due to stimulus checks and the deferment of student loan payments. This gave many consumers a lot of free money to spend on whatever they may have wanted. While I do think people will still buy at retailers’ stores it is important to watch the consumers’ money supply and how much they have to spend on products. Part of this also comes from looking at the amount of credit the consumers are using..

**Strengths:**

1. Brand Name and reputation - 
   1. Nordstrom is a very well-known brand in the fashion industry and with the average consumer. This can be seen in their social media growth especially on Instagram. This is really one of the legacy brands in modern fashion so people tend to trust the company and continue to buy both private label and branded products.
2. Digital Growth
   1. One of the main points made in their 10Q for Q3 2021 is the need to become more of a data-driven company. They are doing this by implementing more data features within their app and through their online store. This will allow them to pivot faster and continue to deliver products that customers truly want.
3. \~Large Physical footprint in malls or shopping centers
   1. Nordstrom is one of the fashion retailers that actually has many physical stores across a lot of malls. While I think this is a strength for those who want to get back to the mall, the higher mall rents and contracts will continue to eat into their bottom line. Also, if a lot of new customers are buying online rather than in stores, this will quickly turn into a huge business liability. So when you are looking at this company make sure to check what their in-store sales are doing and just the overall mall business as a whole for other companies as well. I think that their stores in fashion outlets like Nordstrom rack can provide a better opportunity rather than a full-on shopping mall.

**Risks:**

1. Current Leverage position
   1. As mentioned earlier they have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, especially when compared to their small cash size. They could liquidate their inventory to cover this, but if the company reached that point it would be spiraling down anyways. There may come a point where the risk to reward on this may be worth it, but for me personally, the debt combined with the glum outlook makes me want to sit on the sidelines longer to see how the business does over the next year.

1. People paying for student loans and not deferring house payments or stimulus checks
   1. It is obvious that many have been spending much more over the last year or so and a big component of that is the stimulus checks and student loan deferment. You can see that the chart below shows the spending over the last few quarters ([link](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending#:~:text=Consumer%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20averaged%206075.38%20USD%20Billion,the%20first%20quarter%20of%201950.)). This is definitely something you want to watch especially if there is any recession or reversion back to less consumer credit and overall spending happening. While this is more macro than some of the other points in this article is an important fact to point out because JWN should be firing on all cylinders this year if it benefits from the mass increase in consumer spending. Also, this may push some to buy from the Nordstrom Rack brand rather than the Nordstrom brand.

1. Declining Mall Business
   1. This would not be a complete article about a large mall-based store if we did not talk about the decline in mall business overall. An article from pymnts.com pointed out “Data from Placer.ai show that foot traffic was down 6.5% at indoor malls in September compared to 2019 and down 5.2% at outdoor malls. That’s a less steep decline than six months ago when indoor mall foot traffic was down 21% and outdoor was down 8.4%, but it’s a fall nonetheless. In the past six months, only July has seen an increase in mall traffic — 1% for indoor shopping centers and 1.8% for outdoor” ([Link](https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2021/mall-sales-are-up-but-shopping-centers-still-have-a-traffic-problem/)). This foot traffic is also hit by the lack of international tourism. This is definitely something you want to watch over the next couple of quarters for a company like Nordstrom. 
2. Increased Supply and Labor cost
   1. Lastly, inflation will definitely hurt a company like Nordstrom because they are not going to be able to pass every cost onto its consumer. The input costs like shipping and supplies have gone up significantly along with the cost of labor and just turnover in general. The costs from these factors will hurt the bottom line of the company as long as we are in the current environment.

**Closing Thoughts:**

The valuation may be looking favorable based on the assumption listed in the DCF above, but I do not think the business risks outweigh the valuation currently. From a risk to reward perspective you are hoping they can turn around the business when their enterprise value is nearly double their market cap. I think that the debt along with the capital leases will not allow them to have margin expansion like some of their e-commerce counterparts. If you believe in this turnaround play it could be an opportunity to look into more, but for me personally, I am waiting until I see the turnaround or if the valuation falls to a large margin of safety beyond the current price.",1639956089.0

Unfortunately all the other Yearly Chart patterns failed. We now have a broken Yearly Chart pattern. I assume we need to look at the patterns, and if anything translate them to a range or throw them out.

Maybe the crash pattern will hold and we will have a worse crash in February or sooner? I think we could just be range bound for up to the next 2.5 years. Obviously we know what the top of the pattern is. 

Hopefully I am wrong and the top turns out to be support starting next year for the range as I am assuming being range bound. It would be nice if the range is bound by continuous sectors rotating, rallying and failing, like we have had. If you're good at playing the mini sector rotations it could pay off even just on covered calls.

For now I am continuing to hold long, as I am looking at a four to six year hold on what I have. For the first time I am looking at the possibility of covered calls. I knew I should have done it last time GM was over $60 but was to possessive. 

Are there any Yearly Chart patterns that haven't failed?

5971,The Death of the Dollar,rk3uub,"

The Death of the Dollar 

Within this survey of the dollar, I will delve into the value of the dollar both past and present and the significance of its value. This delving will yield an understanding of what main factors influence the value of the dollar and thus the impact of that gain or loss of value on the common man. In attempting to discover these influences on the dollar, other fiat systems will be used as an example so as to better understand our own system and possible predicament. While no two situations will ever play out in the exact same manner, even a basic understanding of statistics and correlation will elucidate the importance of these examples. Moreover, once an adequate understanding of the dollar and its likely path have been discovered, I will then look at what is to be done about this course. While hind sight is 20/20, taking harmless preemptive action against a probable outcome surely can do no harm.

Let us first look at the purchasing power of the dollar since 1900 in order that we may understand what has happened in the past. Through this past we may possibly gleam some nugget of the future. As demonstrated by the chart on the right, the dollar has lost most of its purchasing power since 1900. The dollar of 2020 is worth 1/26, or 3.8%, of the dollar of 1900, and why is this? There are two main causes that I attribute to the devaluation of the dollar. the first of these reasons is the government. The government prints money in order to solve problems which increases money supply, thus devaluing the currency. The government also took the dollar off of the gold standard which was preventing the Federal Reserve, whom I will call the Fed or in some cases JPOW, from increasing fiscal stimulus to the degree they thought necessary. Secondly, there is the Fed who has two main tools at their disposal in terms of monetary policy. The first tool is to control interest rates, low rate = growth stimulation ... high rate = economic contraction. The second tool the Fed has at their disposal is the issuance of treasury bonds. This allows the Fed to create Treasury Bonds and give them to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department then gives the bonds to the banks who in turn sell them back to the Federal reserve thus creating money and fiscal stimulus. When understanding these two main factors it is very easy to see how the dollar of our forefathers was much stronger than the dollar we have today. One must also ask themselves, with rampant money printing and an enormous national debt, should one really expect an increase in the value of the dollar or continued devaluation through inflation? 

https://preview.redd.it/abzqiyapuj681.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=f455dd464e7a8786f4cef730916e1431e9f7f6e7

Let us now entertain that the value of the dollar, and thus the wealth of Americans, were to increase. How could this happen and what would be the catalyst of such a return in strength to the dollar? there are two scenarios that most directly apply to the current situation. Scenario A is that the dollar strengthens and inflation recedes. In order for the dollar to strengthen at this point in time, the Fed would have to meaningfully raise rates. The Fed would also have to cease all fiscal stimulus through its treasury issuance and buybacks in order to give strength to the dollar. If the Fed were to follow this course of action, there would be a decrease in the money supply, restoring some value to the dollar. The Fed has stated that it will cease its treasury issuance over the coming months, and while this is necessary for the beginnings of a strong economy, it is not enough. The other “tool” the Fed has is to raise or lower rates. The Fed recently stated that it plans on three rate hikes in 2022. with these three rate hikes, the interest rate should be somewhere around 0.9% going into 2022. Typically, the stock market doesn’t like news of rate hikes, but during the most recent FOMC announcement, the stock market surged. This recent surge is Wallstreet laughing at the Federal Reserve as they realize that this will have no meaningful effect on inflation. These rate hikes will have no real effect on inflation because inflation is currently, as of November 2021, sitting at 6.9%. With the Federal Fund Rate sitting at .25% the real rates that are experienced on loans are -6.65% what this essentially means is that money is free to borrow, thus leading to the surge in both the stock market and the housing sector since March 2020. 

Scenario B is my personal favorite as it would be akin to ripping off the band aid. In Scenario B, JPOW would have to raise rates past the rate of inflation in order to slow and kill inflation. In the 80’s, the CPI surged to 14%. The response of the Fed at the time was to raise rates to 20%. This indeed worked and within three year the CPI measure was back down to 3.5%. Now that it is clear that this has worked in the past, why can’t the Fed just jack interest rates up in order to quell inflation? The difference is debt. If the Fed were to raise rates to the point where they would have an impact on inflation, everyone would default on debt. The amount of debt in our system is so large that the government has to increase the debt ceiling to pay off other debt and so on. If the rates went up in any meaningful way, the stock market as well as most asset classes would absolutely disintegrate making the previous crashes of this century look like a cakewalk. Not only is debt in our financial system at all-time highs, but margin borrowing has skyrocketed. These two factors alone would be enough to cause absolute chaos in the system of rates were to increase. So now that we understand that the Fed can’t raise rates because this would cause an unimaginable issue for literally everyone, what seems to be the most logical course of action for the Fed and the government? 

Though the solution that I believe the Fed has chosen may seem simple or naïve, think about why this is the best course of action. The Fed, in my view, can do nothing and therefore will do nothing. They will feign concern and pitifully act as if they were actually fighting inflation hard. But ultimately there will arise more and more excuses about why they must continue quantitative easing through low rates and the creation of money. Reasons such as Omicron, or as Greg Mannarino calls it, “Moronic”, unemployment and government spending will conveniently pop up. The Fed is not solely to blame as our governing bodies are terrible at managing spending and great at spending what they do not have. The outcome of the Fed’s actions will indeed be an increase in inflation through greater money supply primarily. This is their endgame. In high inflation, government debts erode away and while the poor become poorer, the rich become increasingly wealthy. Ultimately, the Fed is between a rock and a hard place and has two choices. One, crash the economy in one fell swoop and be known as public enemy number one. Or two, crash the economy invisibly by destroying the dollar through inflation. Which do you think they will choose? 

Having gained an understanding as to the main reason our dollar has declined 96.2% since 1900, what will its value be in the future? Inflation through monetary policy is not going away anytime soon as shown through our past, but let us look to the past of another country that experienced high inflation. Through this we may glean a nugget as to where we’re headed and what is to be done about it. It is also important to note that no fiat currency has survived the test of time. In fact, 20% of all fiat money systems have failed through hyperinflation. While this example below of what happens to a currency during high inflation, its similarities are striking to the current conditions in America. Rising prices, low productivity and the use of money 

 https://www.businessinsider.com/hungarys-hyperinflation-story-2014-4 

printing to solve the issues of the day occurred in Hungary and are happening now in America. In Hungary, real wages fell by 80% or more and savings accounts were utterly decimated. Please either read this article in full attain an understanding of what happens to the purchasing power of average citizens during this event. 

It is difficult to fathom that such an event could take place here in America, but that is what makes it all the more likely and devastating. False presumptions of security often lead to lackadaisical policy and oversights that leave systems vulnerable. It is for precisely this reason that we must look at the logical likelihood of this event. When looking at all of the economic data that is available today the state of our economy is not as rosy as MSNBC would have you believe. This data also points to the fact that we are already experiencing a high inflation environment and that most have not realized this yet. And while there is a massive amount of data that is pertinent, I shall summarize the most important of this data. 

* Debt as a Percentage of GDP is now 125%. Our production capabilities are severely lacking. 
* Initial unemployment claims keep exceeding economist expectations.
* Record amounts of job openings indicate either a lack of willingness to  
 work or salary shopping in a competitive hiring market. 
* Supply chain issues are also driving prices higher. 
* Home sales are down even with real rates being negative 
* Credit debt is through the roof
* The CPI came in at 6.9% 

https://preview.redd.it/wyjwxw1kvj681.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=62cd2d6e708a930585cb20dc352ed984664602e7

Now that we have established that it is not out of the question that we may experience some similar inflationary event, I would like to look at the CPI. This is the official measure of inflation that is presented to us by the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics. While a reading of 6.9% shocked many, I would like argue that this number is egregiously false and in fact acts as a cover for the true nature of what is unfolding in the system. How is this number calculated, and has this formula changed? This number is calculated through an aggregate of average prices across the main consumer products and their increase or decrease as a collective compared to prior readings. The Formula for the CPI has been  
 changed twice and, in both cases, certain consumer necessities were removed from the equation such as housing costs. Shadowstats, a website that provides us with a CPI reading of 15% based on the older  
calculations, states the benefit that the change in the formula yields, 

In general terms, methodological shifts in government reporting have depressed   
reported inflation, moving the concept of the CPI away from being a measure of the   
cost of living needed to maintain a constant standard of living. 

So if the measure of inflation has been tampered with to hide the true inflation, then isn't this issue already much worse than the Fed and government want us to believe? Most certainly, and with the Fed not able to raise rates, it does certainly appear as if we might be on the cusp of high inflation or even hyperinflation. This is especially so given the fact that quantitative easing will most certainly continue. 

https://preview.redd.it/rbjoaf1xvj681.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=8557a5d185d5bddc8c94954cc68f9487fa35397a

So the inflation rate is high, but what gives? the very last kicker is this little thing called the velocity of money. The following paragraph succinctly describes this phenomenon and was pulled from an article regarding hyperinflation and money velocity. 

“At the beginning of every hyperinflation, it looks like everything is okay. The economy is emerging from a crisis, usually a deflation or some kind of recession, and things are getting better. People feel more prosperous because the storm has passed and there’s more money around from the extra currency the government has printed. Markets like housing and stocks tend to rise. But this is an illusion because prices have yet to adjust for all the extra currency that was created. Why does it have to adjust? Because inflation is not just the result of a spike in money supply, but also money velocity. In simple terms, this is a measure of how frequently currency changes hands. As citizens begin to feel better about the state of the economy, they spend more. That extra money now starts to enter the economy and prices begin to move higher as it circulates more and more. Even though central bankers can control the money supply, they can’t control velocity. And since money velocity is largely a psychological phenomenon, it’s very hard to change it back once it takes hold. This is how inflation has historically gotten out of control and led to hyperinflation.”

 The velocity of money in the system has yet to spike, but as this article mentions, this spike will only really come at a point when the general public realizes what is happening. Then there will be a move out of the dollar, which is losing value, and a move into hard assets such as tools, non-perishable food and any real thing whose value is not predicated on the dollar, but on supply and demand. 

So, what can we do to protect our families and preserve our wealth through such an event? Looking at a hyperinflation case, the Weimar Republic, there is one asset that clearly was successful at wealth preservation. While this may seem cliché, that asset was gold. According to the IMF, gold is “the only asset which runs no counter-party risk.” We may also include silver into this example because both act in the same way with regard to inflation, but have different uses. An article from GoldSilver.com succinctly states the role of gold and silver in such a hyper-inflationary event, 

In the Weimar Republic during hyperinflation, gold did what it’s supposed to do: its   
value skyrocketed during hyperinflation. Over the five-year period that included   
hyperinflation, the gold price increased 1.8 times faster than the inflation rate. In   
other words, not only did someone holding gold survive during the Weimar   
hyperinflation, their purchasing power actually increased by nearly double. Contrast   
that with the fact that most people's savings were completely wiped out. Even the   
wealthiest citizens were turned into poor ones literally overnight, except for those   
that owned gold and silver. 

This example also holds true in all other inflation and hyperinflation cases. So, it appears as though one should own both gold and silver in the case of currency devaluation. Since the dollar has been losing value consistently over the past 120 years, why should now be any different? 

Beyond the fact that gold and silver become intensely useful during inflation for their ability to preserve wealth, they also hold their value even in what we perceive as ‘normal’ times. To demonstrate this, I will now present historical value and thus purchasing power of both the dollar and gold. In 1900, a loaf of bread cost $0.04 USD. In 2021, a loaf of bread costs an average of $3.3. With one dollar in 1900 you could have bought 25 loaves of bread. The price of gold in 1900 was $20.67. In order to equate the dollar to gold we will equate the dollar amount to the gold price for an accurate comparison. With 1 oz of gold you could have bought about 516 loaves of bread and with $20.67 USD you could've bought about 516 loaves of bread. Today the price of 1 oz of gold is around $1800 USD. Thus, an oz of gold could buy about 545 loaves of bread today. That same $20.67 USD, would buy you a meager 6 loaves of bread. This also holds true for almost everything that one could buy. A fully tailored men’s suit cost about $20 in 1900. today that won’t even buy a tie whereas an oz of gold could buy a tailored suit. So, it becomes clear that gold not only held, but did in fact gain value in the past 120 years while the dollar lost almost all its value. It is important also to run inflation adjusted returns on the stock market because the real returns are far less than the thousands of percent the charts show. 

If either of the aforementioned scenarios do in fact play out, which one inevitably will, then gold’s primary function should be thought of as a wealth vessel until such a time that a new system arose which gained the public trust. Silver in this circumstance could also play the role of the vessel, but would almost certainly be more useful in the day to day needs since silver’s intrinsic value is less. If the hyperinflation came to pass, then there would also be ample opportunity to grow one’s wealth too. This could be in the form of real estate for example. Many people would default on their mortgages and there would be many incredible deals. These deals won’t be able to be taken advantage of in the increasingly worthless fiat currency, but if one had gold or silver, a seller would be willing to sell for something that has real value. On a side note about mortgages and adjustable rate debt. In hyperinflation, ordinary debt such as a car or house loan, interest rates on any debt are not locked in. A clear example of this happened in Mexico when during their hyperinflation, mortgage rates changed daily. Even those who had locked in an interest rate for 5-10 years were not safe as the government and banks just changed the rules. So, moving forward, one should be as careful as possible about how much debt they take on. It would be wise to avoid taking on more debt than one could currently pay off with their available cash. 

Now, understanding that gold and silver hold and even gain value over time, and that these metals perform well in any scenario, one must understand two important things. First, the quality or type of metal to acquire. When looking at the quality or type of metal to acquire, there are two main factors: liquidity and purity. Basically, any bullion that one buys should be well recognizable and have an appropriate size for its use. For example, 1 oz silver coins could be used to buy food or basics necessities, whereas 100 oz silver bars could be used to buy farm implement, land or larger items. In the case of hyperinflation, gold should most likely not be used, but held until such a time that a new currency or currency stabilization is seen by the general public. Quantity is tough to land upon as everyone has different available means, but a goal might be able to live solely on gold or silver for two or three years while supporting one’s standard of living. Then there could be other set aside for wealth preservation. As a percentage of one’s wealth, it should not be overwhelming, but enough to give the needed security and ability to pounce on opportunity. If one’s means do not currently afford the ability to reallocate a portion of the assets into metals, a slow approach makes the most sense. This slow approach will allow one to grow their security slowly through setting aside a reasonable amount of each paycheck for the acquisition of physical bullion. It should be noted that any bullion purchased should always have the troy weight as well as the purity stamped upon it. Without these, your bullion will be useless or difficult to use. It should also be noted that certain mints will be widely recognized such as the RCM and Perth Mint, thus increasing their ease of use through trust in the mint. Lastly, one should shop around and search for the best deals in order to find the best price. Premiums on metals are constantly changing, and depending on the type of coin one purchases, the premium could really eat away at the amount of bullion one ends up with. The goal is to acquire the most of the best bullion for the lowest cost, in order to best preserve wealth and attain ease of use during a hyper-inflationary event. 

The following is a pertinent excerpt from SunshineProfits.com explaining the possible speculative upside to both metals in addition to their ability to preserve wealth, 

Many gold and silver investors believe that the market for both is systematically   
manipulated. There are many variations of this theory: some say that precious metals are   
under the thumb of central bankers, while others blame big banks and their use of   
derivatives (‘naked’ shorts) and high-frequency trading for the declines in the price of gold.   
There are also worries about the discrepancy between Paper and physical gold (appx. 250   
to 1), the fairness of London trading, declining inventories at Comex and leasing of gold by   
central banks. At first glance, this theory makes sense, especially that the price of gold was   
fixed for decades by governments or suppressed under the London Pool Gold, while a few   
financial institutions have already been fined for influencing or manipulating gold prices. 

I would like to note one thing out of this article of particular importance, and that is the paper metal. This refers to certificates or futures contracts that are traded and most often settled in USD. These certificates could be leading to price suppression through the massive increase in liquidity. Basically, if there is more gold, even on paper, then it is worth less. Not only this, but these contracts allow an investor to take physical delivery of the metal. In the event of high inflation, it is almost certain that people will seek a safe haven in gold and silver. If there are 250 claims to every one ounce of silver and even 10% of these take physical delivery a demand driven price increase without direct correlation to inflation is certain. Given that gold and silver win in either ‘normal’ times or hyperinflation, if their price has been suppressed due to the massive amount of paper metal, then it would seem as though they are possibly some of the most undervalued assets in the world currently. 

In summation, it appears as though allocating a portion of one’s wealth to these precious metals seems to be a no brainer. Without serious reform and overhaul, the current system will continue to do what it does best, which is to inflate. Given this, the course of this economy and the value of the dollar appear to be on track towards a very tumultuous time. But I would also have anyone that reads this note that I have used the words seem and appear at almost every turn. This is due to the fact that I am in fact doing what some may call speculation. I would argue that I am in fact presenting a theory. That is that no fiat currency has ever survived and that gold and silver do indeed at least preserve value if not gain value. Lastly, I would have you know that I

Investing In The Roku Lifestyle?
The streaming lifestyle, it appears, is here to stay. If we weren't already glued to our couches before, the pandemic made damn sure that we slowly became integrated into our couch cushions while the dulcet tones of Carole Baskin blared out over the soundbar. Today, there are more options than ever to stream. You have the heavy hitters like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Live, HBO Max, YouTube TV and Disney+. Then you have the second class citizens of the streaming world like Peacock and Apple TV+ (though ""Ted Lasso"" seems to have vaulted this one to the top of most peoples' minds). You have tier three which includes the dross of the internet on Paramount+ and *shudder* Discovery+ . 

Speaking of shuddering, you also have networks like Shudder for horror movies or Britbox for your favorite subtitled shows where they're allegedly speaking the same language. Next up, dig through 50 feet of shit and then you end up at the bottom of the barrel of streaming services. These are the ones I'm pretty sure not even the employees watch, and I'm looking at you Fubo TV, IMDBTV and Tubi. RIP to Quibi which would have been the shining gold turd in the punch bowl of this class, but luckily that one was dragged behind the woodshed in time to save the dignity of a few founders and even fewer investors. Hell, streaming has been around so long now that it even has a pretty established graveyard. Prayers up to BOOM and TCM Filmstruck, both services I had a personal hand in designing and launching in my 9-5 life several years ago.

But this begs the question: with so many streaming services available to the public nowadays, what's the best way to access them? You could drop $500 on an Xbox and have a horrible user interface to deal with. You could grab a device manufactured by one of the big guys like Amazon with their Fire Stick, but then you risk getting dragged into a custody battle like the only child in a divorce court. So where do you go? Well, plucky underdog Roku might have your answer. 

What Is The Business?
As is standard practice for companies in the streaming game, Roku has a few different segments that drive their main sources of revenue:
Hardware sales

Platform revenue

Original content

Hardware Sales
Roku is a rare breed of streaming service in which they actually produce their own set-top boxes, referred to as OTT (over the top, as in over the television) products. This was the start of life at Roku, and their game originally was to provide low-cost ways to stream other services in your home. Since then, Roku devices have gotten a little more expensive, but have included new features like the ability to stream in 4K and faster chip-sets. They recently got back to their roots, however, when they announced an exclusive deal with Walmart to sell an entry-level $15 streaming stick, seemingly a shot across the bow of Amazon and Google alike. In Q3 of 2021, this segment generated approximately $97.4 million for the business and was their second largest revenue generator. As a fun side note, this business segment also includes the licensing agreements for the buttons on their remotes. They've even figured out how to monetize the remote!

Platform Revenue
This is actually the largest segment of Roku's revenue at present. This segment entails the software partnerships they have with television manufacturers, as well as the advertising therein. RokuOS, named ""Roku TV"" in their consumer facing materials, boasts an impressive 15 television manufacturer partners worldwide, and their OS also powers the set-top boxes I described a minute ago. According to The Motley Fool, the combination of the TV partners and proprietary set-top boxes has seen Roku leap to #1 in the United States for television operating system usage, capturing a 38% market share.

The volume of RokuOS users also begets extreme advertising revenue for the company, as they farm out the space within their app to external ad vendors and partners. This advertising and partnership revenue clocked in at a company-record $582.5 million in their Q3 earnings report, an 82% increase year-over-year.

Original Content
Curiously for a streaming service, this is the newest part of their business. I mentioned the dramatic implosion of Quibi in my intro, and Roku were the direct beneficiaries when they purchased all of Quibi's library (minus ""Reno 911"") for $100 million in 2021. I'll talk more about this in a minute.

The Bull Case
Worldwide Expansion
Roku, despite their impressive market share in the U.S, aren't resting on their laurels. They also boast a 31% market share in Canada and declared themselves the kings of streaming in Mexico. Now, it's time for Europe. The company is expanding with physical offices in northern Europe, establishing the newest building in The Netherlands to match their existing offices in the U.K, Ukraine and Denmark. Roku seems to be building on their position of strength and setting up the foundation to be able to more effectively distribute original content. What's that you say? Original content?

Original Content Production
Quibi nonsense, come on down! That's right, I told you it would be back. Using the Quibi back-catalog as a springboard, Roku is reportedly planning to produce more than 50 original content shows in the next two years to populate their exclusive Roku channel of their OS. This channel is free to users that have either a Roku OTT product or RokuOS in their televisions. But why is it free? The advertising!

We already talked about the amount of money Roku raked in with their advertising last quarter, but the filling out of the Roku Channel only serves to see that number balloon, and they're off to a good start. Their first original movie, ""Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas,"" was nominated for a Critic's Choice Award and set all kinds of internal records for the company in terms of viewership on the channel. The future is looking bright for this segment of the business, assuming they continue to knock the cover off the ball with their content.

Traditional TV Continues to Lose
We've all heard about, and maybe even participated in, cord cutting of some type. The major carriers are bleeding users, with an estimated 52% of American consumers expected to have severed their relationship with the major TV carriers by the end of 2022. That's a massive number, which provides ample market opportunity for the streaming middle-class to move in. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have already asserted their dominance in a majority of homes, regardless of if you have traditional television or not. It's the second tier of streaming providers that have a new opportunity to move in, and Roku is uniquely well positioned to be able to provide that access point to millions around the world, especially in the U.S market. As the rising tide of cord cutting continues to lift all streaming boats, consider Roku the Army Corps of Engineers that open and close the damn at will.

Recent Key Partnership Agreements
Actually, let's discuss some of those streaming partners. In the world of streaming, the participants don't always play nice. In order to allow access to streaming content from each provider, the companies have to enter a contract with each other than can often result in protracted nonsense bullshit. For instance, did you have a Fire Stick or FireTV when ""The Office"" made its high-profile move from Netflix to Peacock? Then you were SOL because Amazon and NBCUniversal didn't have a streaming contract, so Peacock was unavailable to you. Did you want to watch ""Wonder Woman 2"" last December for some reason and you were one of the 55 million Americans streaming their options through Roku? Sorry! AT&amp;T (parent company of the HBO Max service) didn't have an agreement with Roku so you couldn't watch it, which honestly was for your benefit in this instance. WW2 was just awful.

I set all this up to say that Roku has now closed many of those gaps in their partnership agreements, the highest-profile of which is locking up a coveted multi-year deal with Google to continue access to YouTubeTV. This is beneficial from not only a revenue perspective (Roku stock popped 18% on the news), but also a PR perspective as it ends the long-standing feud between the two companies that threatened to boil over in October. PR might seem like a weird thing to highlight here, but a bad run of PR can dramatically affect your direct bottom-line results. Just ask Disney.

They've also secured some non-streaming partnerships which could make their advertising game a bit more interesting, including one with Shopify that allows merchants to build, run and measure connected TV ad campaigns. It's a fascinating partnership that directly takes on a company like The Trade Desk or Magnite, and could see advertising CPM's on Roku's platform explode in the coming years. To get a sense of just how many merchants are on the Shopify platform, you can read my deep dive into that company here.

The Valuation is Compelling (Finally)
For once with one of these things I can finally put valuation in the ""win"" column. Roku, at time of writing, is currently trading at $221. That's a staggering 50% off its all-time highs back in 2020 when the company rode the ""stay at home"" wave all the way up to $490. While the company has come back down to earth like their seat belt broke on Tower of Terror, the new trading levels for this company make it a compelling, albeit very strange, value play.

I'll touch on the infinite money-pit that is original content in a second, but their revenue is accelerating quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, even when they stack their 2021 numbers up against the almost unfair comps of 2020. Their most recent earnings quarter saw revenue jump over 50% and net income skyrocket 432% over the same time in 2020. They're getting more effective and more efficient, but have still seen their shares beaten down over the last 12 months. Well, Wall Street has noticed. 22 Wall Street analysts have weighed in and the company is classified as a ""Moderate Buy"" by analysts with an average price target of $401, implying an 80% upside.

The Bear Case
They're Late To The Original Content Game
So $100 million for Quibi's back catalog is a lot, right? In absolute terms, absolutely. In terms relative to their competitors? Not so much. Let's look at the king of the pride, Netflix.

Netflix has seen their budget for original content balloon since they began taking it seriously in 2013. The now-problematic Kevin Spacey led the service's first flagship series, ""House of Cards,"" adapted from the British series, which was met with critical and audience acclaim. Netflix had proven that original content could be developed, and they inadvertently sparked an arms race that is spiraling out of control. How out of control you ask? Very!

2014 saw Netflix enter the market with an original content war-chest of about $3 billion. Since then, that number has skyrocketed to $17 billion in 2021, as reported by the company during their most recent earnings report. And that number isn't just spend on random content that won't perform. Their algorithm is so finely tuned that they know what works and they absolutely blast it. Netflix is adept at opening the checkbook to a variety of projects, each one performing better than the last. 2020 saw the unexpected hit ""Tiger King,"" as well as award-darling ""The Queen's Gambit."" The Crown"" cleaned up at this year's Emmy's, and the return of ""Stranger Things"" is one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the last few years thanks to COVID-related delays. The company also pumps out critical flops that consumers can't get enough of, like ""Red Notice,"" the company's most watched film. They've also found success with international projects like ""Lupin"" and 2021's out-of-left-field explosive hit ""Squid Game."" The company can't stop, and won't stop, which puts Roku in a weird position.

We've already discussed that Roku's bread and butter is advertising and OTT, but does the foray into original content leave them in a precarious position? Even Netflix, with their seemingly unlimited balance sheet, has seen original content production creep up to nearly 50% of their annual spend. Roku's positioning in the landscape will be relatively minor at best, but the influx of new shows and content could see them setting money on fire unless the Roku TV channel is a smash hit and they can charge through the nose for advertising. It'll come down to batting average: Netflix can afford to bat like a minor league player because of the sheer volume of content they produce, with the success of the lesser number of hits outweighing the higher number of misses. Roku, in this belabored metaphor, will basically have to be Babe fucking Ruth in order to compete. 

So what's the next production for Roku's original content channel? Apparently it's ""This Old House,"" which I could bottle and use as a sleep aid. The only people that show is going to appeal to are those in their 90's and people on hospital beds with ""locked in"" syndrome.

The Bottom Line
Roku, it turns out, is an incredibly strange company. What started effectively as a hardware manufacturer has effectively pivoted into an ad-tech company with a side of streaming. They not only provide the access point to your favorite content, but they sell ads to you on top of that and are now looking to become your favorite source of content, despite some currently questionable content decisions. The company is taking their partnerships and operating system to the next level simultaneously, all while seeing revenue and income accelerate quarter-over-quarter. The company to me is a screaming ""long"" and thanks to those of you that requested this one so I could dig into it a bit more!

Wh did fADTX is a fidelity technology fund. It crashed 11% on Friday, but looking at its major holdings I can not make sense of this much of a crash. Yes the holdings went down a bit but not this much.
Here are the top holdings 

From booking g at the top holdings of AAPL,MSFT, and NVDA I can not make sense of this fall.  Here is a look at the holdings https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/fadtx/holdings

Maybe I don’t understand how a mutual fund was priced but I thought it was a function of its constituents.

I also took a second to look around and googled to try to find out why it crashed so bad on Friday but I could not find anything.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrhl5o/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv76ty/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/)

From the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress. I added a small early exercise in 2019 and updated the starting balance to all the vested options.

&#x200B;

[ Table 1 2012-granted and vested option exercise ](https://preview.redd.it/5718oj47gj681.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=304abddcdbe9cf56f61df82f4a53a984458a92cd)

There are still 6.4M options to exercise, which can be done in the last two weeks of the year keeping the current pace.

&#x200B;

[ Table 2  Elon’s share transactions \(negative denotes sell\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/5pmoscv5gj681.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1e4ef441f40b2a49f46607926c259d8ac93208)

Total sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 58.64%. The big question is whether there will be a big chunk of shares sold the next two weeks. Sell-off will either flare up to 6M shares per week (similar to the first week of sell-off), or linger at 1-2M per week and go into next year.

I made around $2K with long-dated TSLA puts and short shares. I have no idea what I am doing, but I am looking at getting shorter DTE TSLA puts hedged by SPX calls, in case the market decides to moon taking TSLA with it.

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

2019 Wordpress buys Tumblr for $3 million

Why?

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs.

6040,Snapchat is primed to the tits !,rjzjme,"TLDR IS AT THE BOTTOM-

Snapchat, its an app all of us (atleast i hope) have herd about or used before ... you know to send nudes and get sneaky links and shit like that . Well  right now at a very strong level of support which is around the 45 dollar mark . Also its about had enough downside as it really cant stay below 45 for much long before rallying from 44-45 back to around 54 bucks where it has strong resistance . Furthermore it has a gap to fill from 77 bucks . It fell due to a miss on its revenue by ... 3 million dollars . WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

6084,You Don’t Need To Buy Reddit Stocks To Own The Website 📊,rjwupk,"
I saw few different posts saying we should buy 51% of Reddit Stock to own the subreddit and change rules, although these are memes and jokes but the concept behind this is already being worked on by Reddit themselves!

Reddit are decentralizing their own platform by introducing Reddit Community Points to certain subreddits, this is done by tokenizing Karma - each month users gets tokens equivalent to their Karma (Posts and Comments in the subreddit), this number gets reduced by 2.5% each month until all tokens are minted 2035 approximately.


https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction

https://www.reddit.com/community-points

This project launched (Beta / Testnet) on May 2020 with rCryptocurrency and rFortnite subreddits being involved (Moons and Bricks).

At the moment there are 200k+ unique holders for these Community Points.

Reddit Community Points (RCPs) are tokens/shares of ownership .


**What is the usage of these points?**

1. Voting Power in Governance Polls that changes the subreddit rules.

2. Tipping between users on Reddit.

3. Buying premium Membership on Reddit.

4. Converting Points to Reddit Tokens.

5. Buying Budgets and items on Reddit.



**What is unique about this?**

True ownership, once you receive the tokens, no one can take them from you or manipulate them, even Reddit themselves.

Reddit Community Points can be traded like any other tokens! Imagine WSB getting unique tokens for its holders - Like Joseph Lubin said “If you think GME story is wild, wait until Reddit Tokens launch on Mainnet “.

https://mobile.twitter.com/ethereumjoseph/status/1354589623238930435




**Edit:**

Some comments are right about Karma farming and low content, that exactly what happened to rCryptocurrency, but as the time goes they implemented restrictions that eliminated bad posts/comments, now look at rCryptocurrency - you won’t see any spams and karma farming.. most of the posts are quality ones and people think twice before posting because the incentive now (Unlike before) is posting good content.


Some restrictions that can be:

Increase the minimum Karma for post/comment,
No Points for low characters comments / Gifs,
Limit the daily comment/posts count, 
If WSB token named “Diamond”, limit posts and comments with that name/tag to 2 a day in the hot posts. 

There are probably more, but I hope you get the concept, it’s not just making fair game, it’s always putting the subreddit in improvement mode where Moderators are striving for best content while catching bots and violations, Redditor are more active in the subreddit state (Taking decisions, helping the mods and doing their best for the subreddit performance) and the subreddit itself gets more users/investors usually from outside of the subreddit which increases the popularity.


*The reason Reddit Community Points are not popular yet is: they are on Testnet/Beta version, once on Mainnet - it will be very different situation.",1639920800.0

# Inflation

Now the official inflation figures are quite scary by themself but wait further until you see the exchange rate. You'll notice that the real interest rate is around -5%.

Erdogay in his infinite wisdom fired two central bank governors this year, and appointed a spineless fuck that has been emptying their reserves on forex interventions twice this week ([https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases](https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases)).

&#x200B;

This week erdogan has put himself in a tight spot either raise interest rates and look like a pussy or face a revolution due to poverty. As a fundamentalist with a small dick and a huge ego he started the printing mill by raising minimum wage by 5%,... oh sorry excuse me ... 50% !

If we all get together and own 51% then we will own this entire website.

We could make the rules, profit from the advertising, and finally get paid for the memes we make.

I've even come up with a list of things we could do as new owners:

1. Reddit mods can apply for paid-internships at Reddit. This is much closer to having a real job than what they currently do and would benefit the organization.
2. Your flair is your official title at the company. IE: instead of ""CFO"" you'll be ""PotatoFart""
3. NSFW posts will receive special protections--and if you happen to work in our new skyscraper then NSFW posts are automatically considered SFW.
4. Everyone gets a turn in the corporate jet.
5. Elon becomes a mod. He can also apply to become a paid intern.
6. We have a monthly party on our company yacht: *The S.S. VisualMod*.
7. Our corporate cafeteria is a dining hall with fast food restaurants along the side--but they're all Wendy's.

I think this is a great idea.

Keep it high and tight.

Edit: Well, if you guys are going to spend money on awards for this dumb post IDK how we're going to buy enough Reddit shares to own the company. Mission aborted.

6271,Market cap of the CJNG drug cartel?,rjil87,"A seemingly reasonable estimate of Mexican and Colombian total drug market revenue is between [$18B and $39B USD](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/24/do-mexican-drug-cartels-make-billion-year/). According to the same article, other estimates for Mexico are 5 to 7 billion,  $15B, and $21B. The revenue estimate given for the Sinaloa cartel specifically is $3B, though this is in 2018 so the numbers are a bit old.

Assuming CJNG is comparable to Sinaloa Cartel, let's say revenue is $3B. Again assume costs are low and it's a high margin industry, so $2B is in profit. With a ""normal"" P/E ratio of 30, that would make the market cap $60B (comparable to Ferrari, Mercado Libre, Capital One, Progressive). With a more exuberant P/E valuation, market cap could of course be double that ($120B: Goldman Sachs, Moderna, HSBC), and the stock price would be even greater assuming more revenue/profit than $3B.

Curious what people think, this is very much a back-of-envelope calculation, not investment advice etc.",1639867537.0

LOGI has strong earnings and has beaten the estimates every quarter this last year even as it falls in price. Its at a 52 week low and I think it's hit its bottom and undervalued right now. Duetche Bank initiated a Buy rating on the 13th. In the last few days Omicron is spreading faster, doubling infection rates every 2 days right now so this may send some workers back to home offices. The Government order for mandatory vaccinations for companies with over 100 employees is back in effect as of 2 days ago, which may also send some people back to the home office. Gaming is strong. All good news for LOGI. It also pays a dividend.

So here is a recent paper (November, 2021) published by the US Treasury about the topic.

Title:  ""RECENT DISRUPTIONS AND POTENTIAL REFORMS IN THE U.S. TREASURY MARKET:

Disruptions in the biggest and most liquid market in the world... sounds like Godzilla.

6401,Is it time to buy growth stocks?,rjavnj,"* A part of my speculative portfolio is in growth and certain coins. But I've been looking at growth companies and many are down more than 70% from ATH. Some even became penny stocks and are hugely oversold. I know about the interest rates hike next year, but I also think it is partly priced in. Everyone says it's foolish to buy growth now, but the crowd always states the obvious. When these sticks were high a year ago they said you should buy them. Also, yesterday I saw a very peculiar thing. The indices were red, with DJI down - 1,5%, and only the Russell 2000 closed 1% in the green. It was a witching day, but do you think it's a start of a rotation? Or simply big institutions been covering their short positions in growth and selling their long positions in big tech and value?

6500,Short Reddit After They IPO?,rj5cgx,"There a lot of talk about Reddit severely restricting or eliminating NSFW content after they IPO to satisfy skittish investors and the religious right. We all know what happened after once mighty Tumblr banned adult content - their user base evaporated by almost 50% practically overnight and they are no longer a household name. Even bringing back limited amounts of adult content didn’t help them. 

If Reddit pulls the same stunt, how long so you think that it will take their stock to tumble and what way would be the best way to capitalize on it?

Reddit was invented by young libertarian types but has slowly acquiesced to demands of the government and special interest groups. There is a long line of failed social media sires before Reddit came on the scene and Reddit’s technology could be easily replicated. 

I only see corporate board types and shareholders destroying the formula that makes Reddit special.

Typing on my phone so bear with me

Last few days have been a bloodbath. However, each day was a defensive rotation except today. Today we saw large caps fell while small caps and growth stocks rose sharply, which in no way is considered a defensive play. Look at ARKK, it rose 5% today. Here’s my thought on 2 possible reasons ranked by likelihood 

1. Some hedge fund(s) went under, or was margins called. Essentially it liquidated both long (good asset, large caps) and short positions. This phenomena is similar to what we saw during GME saga. Depending on how isolated this incident was, it could be either a small bump to SPY500 or the start of the next crash.

2. Cathie Wood is going to mary Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk so there’s an influx of investment in ARK ETFs. I made this up but I couldn’t find a second possible explanation why growth stocks are back on the menu and why hedge funds wanted to cover their short positions today 

I think in the next few days, there would be an increase in market volatility. Buying a straddle should be a good way to take advantage of it. We also want to monitor the movements in overnight future market closely. March 2020 also started with hedge fund liquidity problems (not COVID related) and the overnight markets went to the crapper even before everyone was awake.

6876,Blue chips wont be fun next year,rit9im,"Why I believe that sector rotation is inevitable starting now
 
2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market… I won’t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.
No matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn’t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it’s that high anymore… Folks, don’t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it’s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I’d say “yes!” without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.
 
I should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That’s exactly what I’m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don’t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won’t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?
 
 
So following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I’ll pretend I’m an oracle here for a second…
Hedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won’t be a thing of the day anymore and things won’t rally “just because”….. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn’t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.
 
 Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! 

As for myself, I’ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future. Happy hunting everyone!",1639782262.0

I understand the vision though and believe they can deliver as long as they have the right team. It seems like GME really is considering the fact that people like the stonk. 

What’re you’re thoughts on GME going forward? Can you see them as a major player in the space NoFreakingThing  and/or the new FB name? It seems kind of obvious to me for them to really dig deep into those spaces but I guess everyone doesn’t get it yet.",1639777324.0

My position 10 contracts of RIVN 3/18/22 $80  P

Rivian’s stock is shitting the bed today because they announced they are going to under deliver. Well, no shit. It’s only going to worse and here is why. 

Omicron variant. It is going to fuck supply chains even more than they are already fucked. Rivian’s supply chain is immature and they don’t have multiple vendors for various parts. This will cause deliveries to shrink more. 

Labor disruptions. Omicron is going to play havoc with labor which will further exacerbate the supply chain issues in terms of acquiring parts and their own production when they can get the parts. Labor disruptions alone will slow output. Combine it with supply chain disruptions and you have significant output problems. 

Interest rates. They’re going up. This will increase Rivian’s costs leaving them less money to address the first two problems I mentioned. 

It’s only a matter of time before WallStreet big boys start baking these factors in and the stock will steadily decline. By March, my target price for RIVN is $68.

7124,OPK Opko: The Time is Now,rikpmg,"A couple primers/disclaimers: 1) I’m not a fan of biotech or pharma because it’s a total crapshoot full of pump and dumps and false hope. 2) I don’t understand anything scientific/technical in this sector which is why I suck at investing in this sector and typically avoid it. 3) I’m not a shill, I don’t care if you buy it or not, but I do value all opinions—I highly value those with opposing views because y’all have often saved me from making a huge mistake. So I share this with the hopes of receiving feedback and not asshole downvotes. 4) I’m not posting any math because every time I do, people downvote or it just doesn’t get any attention. So I’m going to keep this pretty high level. The math is pretty easy though if you’re interested. Just look at potential market size of a drug and assume you capture a small conservative percentage of that market (look at analogous drugs in the sector). 

My argument: Now is the time to buy OPK  

Why/thesis: 

Opk just received approval on its product called “4K score”. 4K is a new test for detecting prostate cancer which is a huge market. 

Somatrogon approval is also pending. It  treats growth hormone deficiency (GHD). You know those shots that short kids take in middle school and HS to grow taller? That’s what Somatrogon is, but apparently even better. It can also be used to treat some forms of dwarfism. It’s a huge huge market.

Plus, OPK makes covid tests and I think they even make some PPE. Which is becoming a major market again thanks to this shitty new variant (hope everyone is staying safe and healthy). So OPK has some cash flowing in and it has a nice partnership with PFE, which parlays into my next point. 

Between the “4K score” approval and Somatrogon, OPK is ripe for a buyout. PFE and opk are pretty intertwined already, makes sense for pfe to just buy them out at $10-$15 now before the price really gets out of control.",1639757361.0

Alright degenerates!   
TAK is what we all have been looking for. A good stock, undervalued, underperforming and with little volume = no crazy options contracts prices. Right now TAK have really good rumors and news. They are working towards great projects, patents and few vaccines, one of them is the COVID. (This was published yesterday 16/12/21)

Another thing we might worry in the market is about inflation. We can see with this stock a ""anti-inflation"" due to the good dividend and the upside potential it has since the market has been underperforming due to OMICRON. We are in the perfect time to buy.  So we are looking for a good dividend + appreciation value of shares,  a great deal, right!?  


**More good news**  


TAK rn has tons of cash and great cash flow, no crazy amount, but tons. What I mean with this is that this gives the opportunity for expansion, new projects, repurchase of shares (which they are doing), and pay their debt (they have debt). This is a great catalysis for a good run up to easy $15-17 per share in the next 6months in my perspective.

[This also was today! ](https://preview.redd.it/85d247ez14681.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5f3a1107cc4158ebc910ddabaa87ca62aaf7884)

They have been underperforming explosively since September, I believe that this is a good and not so famous company in the moment with tremendous opportunity to go to $200B market cap in the next 5 years. A easy 4X growth.   


https://preview.redd.it/8woz3rjh24681.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f60611ee9c8dfe95ac1da3035485d13e085d3a2

There is an excellent sentiment from the earnings reports Q3 in feb/3. The balance sheet, the Income Statements and the Cash Flow, all looks good, better than expected tbh.   


I think the valuation will be quite optimistic, providing a space for this Japanese company on American soil in Boston full of Nerds from Harvard and MIT, to provide a good return to investors.

&#x200B;

**My moves will be the following:**

&#x200B;

I will be accumulating within these weeks a total of 150 shares. starting Today with 75 shares and 4 contracts to open 22. Depending on how it moves, I will be moving (DUH)

&#x200B;

**WHAT do I recommend?**

&#x200B;

Enter, buy and hold. Good dividend, is trampled and will rebound!

&#x200B;

good luck!",1639751401.0

Until something drastically changes, expect to see the volume pressure (usually 2-5%) from his sales impacting the market (most often starting at open or 5 minutes after open).

I will continue to play Tesla intraday only until I see one more sale (one more because that will be the strongest signal that he will end when we predict, and if that uncertainty is resolved we can predict the sale impact moving forward).  Would love to hear other's thoughts on this.",1639745414.0

Here's a workup a Nokia where everything seems to point to a $9 price sometime in 2022, which would be a 50% gain on shares. All the 5g & broadband expansion plus their ip portfolio and things look good. Current price Brokeout and held above it's channel as well. 

Their outstanding share total is the biggest problem, institutional ownership is the 2nd, but they are rebounding and creating an amazing story. All the bankruptcy fears are well in the past, they keep earning new patents like this one for domain name systems. Their switch to hardware systems when Huawei and others are being banned is well timed. Hard for me to see other downsides. Would love to hear some though!

7404,Why inflation is way worse than consensus,ri7vwh,"I'm going to be up front, I have loaded a bunch of spy n aapl puts.

So Jack Dorsey famously tweeted about hyperinflation, which got him mainstream coverage and soon after the stepped down from Twitter. Now he is also the CEO of Block formerly known as Square $SQ so he has insights into millions of merchants and cash app data. He sort of knows what people are buying and whatnot.

Now let's start with what is consensus. CPI is reading 6.8%. Food is up 25-50% for meats. Crude oil and other energies are up. Home prices are up. Stocks are up. SnP500 is up 27% this year. Historical, it usually gives 10% a year. So roughly speaking, 17% above historical averages.

Ok so those are the consensus facts. So what's hiding the hyperinflation? One, covid. Omicron is the latest variant and there will be more variants to slow down the economy if it ever gets hot whenever we reopen. It's really easy to see inflation once you go to eat and sees everyone waiting to get seated and the restaurant is understaffed. They are going to raise prices and only stopping them is covid.

Funny internet money and new ipos and spacs also hide inflation. If those didn't exist, the money would have went to other things and made prices higher. 

We talked about the current hyperinflation, what about the future? Well, the Federal Reserve is going to hike to .75%- 1% by end of next year. I don't think that's enough to slow down the economy. Terminal rate is 2.7% which doesn't stop an inflation of 6.7%. Now the Fed is hoping it's transistory, and they might be right. But the only way inflation comes down is when asset prices come down.

Now let me explain my trade. Why did I buy long term puts on the market and AAPL? Only way we stop inflation is with asset prices coming down. Why not make money on the way down of something inevitable? If we already have hyperinflation, then they have to crash the market to stop it. Therefore you should be hoping for a crash to save the US economy. 

If I'm wrong and the fed keeps letting inflation run another year, I think it's totally worth seeing the collapse of the financial system when they finally hike rates to 10% to stop inflation. So either I'm right and I make money, or I'm wrong and the economy goes into even stronger hyperinflation and crash. I will probably dca into deep OTM puts because the crash will be bigger and bigger until it all collapses. $1 of OTM puts would be worth $1000 or more at that point.",1639711712.0

 The trade saw someone purchase roughly 20,000 call spreads that are  linked to the S&P 500 and expire right before the Christmas holiday.  The transaction involved selling calls with a strike price at 4,750 to  fund bullish options exercisable at 4,650. 

 To Danny Kirsch, head of options at Cornerstone Macro  LLC, the trade conveyed an undeniably optimistic market view, at least  for the short term.  

It’s “a big trade,” Kirsch said in an interview. “It’s playing for a rally over the week and a half.”

7476,DECEMBER 2021 STRATEGY,ri4cuy,"Obviously the market is bearish. And it’s only gonna get more bearish. If we keep buying inverse leveraged ETFS/whatever else, we will literally print money for ourselves. This is totally different from pumping a stock. 

If a company or big investor decides to buy because of the dip, then yeah it might look like a good time to buy. But without the fear of “losing money” from not selling, this is completely not a problem. There is a distinction between pumping a stock and then shorting, versus pumping inverse leveraged etf. It takes hope to pump a stock, but with the fear about the bear cycle, it only makes it easier for us to win. Realistically, ask yourself if it’s easier for a stock to go down or up during bear cycle. Stock will not go up if you do not buy, so just keep buying inverse. 

This is similar yet different from the GME and AMC craze. Right now, actual hedge funds even think that market will go down. Back then, it wasn’t like that. You can even see that with the federal reserve news, stock just goes down hours later. This can just keep happening. Furthermore, inverse leveraged etf charts are at ATL. Literally breakout szn.

Take a look out my last post. I’m not hit or miss. I just hit. If u want money like we all made during gme situation then cooperation is key.

Edit: forgot to mention. But I’m a member of profits ulimited. It’s ran by an ex hedge fund faggot. What these guys do is signal their shitty stocks cuz they lost money on it. This guy is signaling robinhood as a buy. The key to win = go against",1639700753.0

7622,Technical Analysis Philosophy; Agree or Disagree?,rhz0mw,"So I've been struggling recently to learn some new Indicators.

Individually, they seem pretty good. But together, it feels like they constantly contradict each other.

One might say ""Time to Buy!"" and the other will say ""No, there's a dip coming, wait"".

It gets frustrating sometimes, more so when it causes you to hesitate one way or the other, and either miss a good Buy in, or don't sell in time before a big drop.

I recently asked a friend of mine who's really good at this, and he told me something I didn't really consider until he said something.

""When you're looking at indicators, somethings 'almost' is good enough'. You're never going to find a 'perfect' buy/sell signal""

Basically he's saying the same thing as the old Idiom ""You'll never hit the Top or the Bottom"". Sometimes, your indicators are going to disagree, and you've got to trust you know how to read which one's right and which one's wrong.

This doesn't mean just between different Indicator's either. Sometimes this might be the same indicator, but different candle sizes (15min vs 3min for example).

&#x200B;

Do you Agree with this Philosophy? That sometimes ""Close enough is Good Enough""?

Or do you prefer to wait for that ""Perfect moment"" when the stars align?",1639685377.0

Over a 60% decline in visitors is forecasted to Nike.com during the holidays (through Dec. 21).

Organic traffic has fallen severely as well as paid searches and is continuing to cut back on paid search. I believe closed factories, delayed delivery, increased shipping costs, inventory issues, as well as worker shortages are beginning to have a toll on Nike forcing it to cut back on advertising during these important holiday seasons.

Here is How About How Landed on It,rhybix,"**Update: Eli Lily CEO stated on CNBC last evening that they expect to get FDA nod in January for $ABCL made - new covid antibody that can kill Omicron and any mutations out there.**

**$ABCL is making for Eli Lily that Ly-Cov1404 antibody that can kill Omicron. You can watch the video on CBC twit:**

[https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1471234088816230407](https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1471234088816230407)

**Funny thing is that I was unware of this development when I was writing.**

**That is big news but I suggest reading forward to see $ABCL value beyond Covid.**

*I also shorted the personal views of life part.No time for that.*

So, as this new guy arround Omicy is doing some more damage, the Covid investing theme has been revamped like an old pleasure worker, getting some charm again.

**We all know the trick: get a winner that might make some nice and fa(s)t gains if it hits gold BUT in the same time to make sure that with out this particular opportunity, it has a bigger value than the one assesed by the market.**

Now many things happened in 2020 also in tech, energy, etc but biotech was hot on pandemic and to elimnate the need to research some other field, I only focused on biotechs.

1. So I browsed and I shuffled eliminating first the ones that are already flying high on Covid fears. Easy money are already made there. No time for that.
2. Then I eliminated the stocks that had debt, like 0 ZERO debt. The rate hike is in the cards and will make  refinancing or repaying that debt harder. No time for that.
3. Further I eliminated (againt my feelings) all the de-spacs. That trend has its own highs and downs and is  you know... keep it simple. Small caps, easy to manipulate stocks - dumped as well.

**And then I started to dig deep in the pipelines of the few left on the table. Some pretty good names there, a lot to read but  $ABCL Abcellera stood right there.**

To be honest I owned some already (bc of Peter Thiel) but my selection was ownership blind. Just going for the target.

Very short backgroudn story - Abcellera become worldwide famous in 2020 as they were the first company on the planet to get EUA for their antibody treatment. After the IPO ABCL surged as high as 70s and now stands at $13.5. They made some nice hundres of millions until now from that antibody but got crushed when vaccines rolled out, got facny again on variant D as their antibody works great on that and it seems they have a new antibody that can kill Omicron too. (see the update in the top of the page). 

**But**, **You know why $ABCL is great?**

**ABCL pipeline has 150 programs and 131 are royalty based. All those 131 programs have nothing to do with Covid. Nothing.**

**What that means is that from any of this 131 programs they stand to win some 5% (source- management)  of the sales.**

**How much is that?**

I googled it - laisy bastard sometimes and I actualy found a guy (but reddit won't let me place a link here) that actually did that math for me:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lskkywl6y581.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ee4fb675f7c1cbc89f0986419d0d45f77be9e3

They have some 700M cash in hand right now and stand to earn some more this quarter as they deliver more antbody and they didn't shown any tendency o dillute stock holders (I'll dig deep in to that later).

Now, 25% success rate seemed too high for my taste (you know lowest risk, right?)

ABCL has a 25+% success rate but the industry average is 15%. I wanted to make the math for an industry average.

This time is much easier: 15 out of 25 is something like 60%. 60% out of 41$ is 24$.

**Even if ABCL would be an average biotech - with this number of programs, the real value of $ABCL would be 24$. Right now if not 1$ would be earned from their covid antibody. Also NO growth rate has been factored in. Like they would not sign another customer in the next decade.**

But, wait (if you're not bored already) and let's seee just how average is ABCL. Who knows, maybe they are under average or not.

**In short about ABCL**

ABCL owns a global database of different antibodies, from humans and lot of species. On top of that full stakc they use AI to identify the best candidate that can kills a bacteria, virus or cancer and that candidate gets cloned, mutiplied and delivered to the pacient.

Spunds like a great idea but are they really good at doing that? Let's see.

**Who's vetting for ABCL**

I am not that smart to judge on scientifical merrits, but I know who's hat smart - big pharma. Seeing who's working with them and actually pays them, can give a clue on how serious are they.

Here is the short list (the ones that I recognized) of partners of ABCL that are also paying for their platform/research right now. Also this guys are responsible for that 131 programs with royalties:

EliLily\*, Sanofi, GSK\*, Novartis, Bill&Melinda Gates, Gilead, Pfizer, Kodiak, Merck, Regeneron\* and very recently Moderna. It is hard to name a big pharma that is not there.

\*Also you might notice among the biotechs using their platform are all the Covid antibody competition.

Each one of those are ordering more programs and many others are joining them quarter by quarter.

Here is the growth rate focusing on programs ony:

***Q2*** ***Total programs under contract of 138, up 82% from Q2 2020***

***Q3 2021- Total programs under contract of 155 adding 17 new programs.***

[***https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/***](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/)

Who else is backing them? O**h, the Canadian Goverment gave them already some 176M.** Some 50M were for the Covid treatment development but 125M was given to build a nice cool factory.

They are building right now a GMP protein biologic manufacturing area and the building will feature laboratory, offices and warehouse space.

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/)

And my favorite early investor (innitial backer)  and member of the board of Abcellera - **Peter Thiel (PLTR, LAZR, ASANA).**

But, hey, if you don;t know who's Peter Thiel ... this is not the place to learn but you should really find time and google it.

**Conclusion**

I already got tired of writing and you got bored with my story.

**Here is the deal :**

* **ABCL IPO price was 20$ (with only some 80 programs and factory paid by Canadian goverment),**
* **ABCL target price (6 analysts median) is 46$**
* **ABCL in my conservative, NO COVID valuation, sets the price at 24$.**
* **Right now you can buy it with 13.5.**

Now, if Covid will stay arround they will make a lot more money like really a lot.

They also have under clinical test a new antibody LY-CoV1404 or Bebtelovimab. As of September 2021 NIH was saying that it can kill ALL Covid variants. IT seems that atacks that protein that don't mutate.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/)

Who knows? Untill FDA says otherwise, we need to see this.

Right now the risks on the table are like this:

Scenario 1: If ABCL puts on the table a proven Omicron killer, the stock will rally and we will never see it at 13.5 again.

Scenario 2: If ABCL gets more contracts with the same or other big guys, or if they publish some positive data from any of those 131 programs, it will rally as their business model will get more and more visibility. Chance are that maybe you can get it again at this price or not.

Scenario 3: If ABCL stops selling Covid antobodies and stop signing new contracts, it will keep develop new drugs and slowlly rise to 24$

Scenario 4: IF ABCL suddenly stops delivering results, gets contracts cancelled and they prove to be a ponzi scheme - we all loose our money and will be proved stupid along Peter Thiel, all the Canadian Gov. (not sure there:) Bill Gates, Pfizer, Sanofi, Gilead, GSK and you get the idea :D.

**Please read this with Russel Brand voice:**

That is what I think but more imortantly is what YOU think. Let me know in the comments.

**Btw, I'm in 1.5K commons averaged and bought the biggest stake at this price.**

7705,Why Star Bulk Carriers ($SBLK) is your next long term play,rhwxcs,"* 0 DTE $spy and $spx contracts are more fun

** Disclosure: I own long positions in SBLK which are currently green, this is not a pump

*** Not financial advice, obviously

Good afternoon idiots. I’m here to tell you why, if you feel want to hold a position for more than a week, you should be throwing your money at Star Bulk Carriers.

Firstly, and less quantitatively, shifting consumer sentiment. Ever since the rona hit in 2020, consumer disposable income has gone away from spending on experiences (i.e., vacations and related expenses, restaurants, etc) and [shifted towards more physical goods.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing) This is only one cause of the supply chain issues that everyone is facing at the moment and is good for all shipping/logistical companies worldwide, but Star Bulk in particular stands to benefit from this more than most due to a [very diverse fleet and projected fleet growth.](https://www.starbulk.com/gr/en/events-presentations/ ) (cited the Sept investor prospectus)

Secondly, they’re a bit over-leveraged. Now, this might sound like a bad thing at first glance, but it’s not. Don’t think Evergrande types of over-leverage, this has to do with their dividend yield. As of writing this, SBLK has a massive 23+% yield, which, once word gets out, a lot of buy-and-hold dividend portfolios are going to buy in simply for that huge payout. However, I do not believe that that yield can be maintained for the long-term, and SBLK will not become a dividend aristocrat like JNJ. They have an interesting variable dividend policy based on cash flow ([which is very, very positive](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBLK/financials?p=SBLK) ), and even though the shipping and marine industry will continue to see uptrends in the short- to medium-term, it is, by nature, a volatile industry and this will play into why that yield will eventually be slashed. That all being said, even with a dividend cut, SBLK will only cut dividends based on cash flow which means that as long as cash flow stays positive (which it is projected to, more on that in a bit), SBLK will continue to tick upward with less dividend safety. Because of this, I believe if you do decide you want to go long SBLK, LEAPS are the play.

Thirdly, the exit plan. As things “return to normal”, so is SBLK’s [revenue and cash flow](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sblk/earnings) projected to normalize (but stay positive) by 2023, which is a lot of time to get in and out. Currently, SBLK has found support around the $19-$20 level, and seems to have held there after the run up over the past year.

In conclusion, this may not be a 10-bagger, but with LEAPS as the investment source, a 2- or 3- bagger isn’t unrealistic. (I personally saw 100% gains a week ago before the whole market took a huge shit and didn’t sell)",1639679564.0

7710,OATLY - CALLS ON LACTOSE INTOLERANCE ($OTLY),rhws8o,"Lactose intolerance is on the rise. This gastrointestinal rejection of our beloved dairy products tells us more than just the truth, it tells us how to invest. This occurred to me just yesterday when I was checking Robinhood on the toilet. Little did I realise, my excessive flatulence was trying to tell me something. Not just how to address my lactose malabsorption, but also how to manage my investment fund.

## Got Milk?

The United States federal government has been artificially sustaining the dairy industry for decades. The USDA recommends every child and adult consume 3 cups of dairy every day despite the fact that 25% of the US is lactose intolerant. The global prevalence of lactose malabsorption is averaged at 68%. How could milk be such an important aspect of our diet if it’s indigestible by more than half the globe? The answer lies in understanding the true consequence of World War 1; an excessive increase in cattle farmers. This overproduction of milk resulted in an unsustainable industry which was promptly addressed via massive subsidization. Big dairy is real and so is the deep soy state.

## Oatly ($OTLY)

Oatly was founded by the Swedish scientist Rickard Öste, the inventor of oat milk. Its products include oat milk, ice cream, cold brew coffee, and other cooking products. (All non-GMO and vegan). This ties well into the trendy vegan globalist agenda, a psyop designed to control the populace and drive the profits of vitamin supplement companies.

How do I judge a company? The same way I judge political candidates, by their website. And to be honest, [Oatly’s website](https://www.oatly.com/en-us) has a nice horizontal scroll with a design that subverts techno feudalistic minimalist websites- in exchange for something a little more visually engaging. The art is a bit corporate but aesthetically sensible. The reason I’m mentioning this is that a well-designed website is a positive signal that the management team is able to find and identify capable talent when scaling for growth.

## Trendy DIY Baristas

It goes without saying that Becky wants to make her own drinks. Even my wife’s boyfriend, Kenneth, makes Oatmilk Mocha Vanilla Frappes every morning. Just look at the pinterest boards, the Google search trends, it all connects. This follows the trend shift from retail to aesthetic consumerism. Oatly is the clearest Becky play.

## Starbucks Partnership

✰$ gets all its Oatmilk from Oatly. I wouldn’t know if it’s any good because Kenneth only lets me drink Starbucks water.

**Bubble Tea**

The bubble tea market is exploding globally. Rapid growth over the next several years. Bubble tea is super popular with GenZ. Lots of the local college girls are always hitting the bubble tea shops. Bullish on bubble tea. Also, the addressable market in China for milk tea is huge since 90% of China is lactose intolerant.

## Becky Play

From now on, I’m going to classify Oatly as a Becky stock. It has all the key components of one. EZ Becky play.

## Neural Networks for Grain Quality Analysis

Rickard Öste utilized artificial neural networks in the late 90s to [analyze grain quality](https://patents.justia.com/patent/5956413). If they were doing this in the late 90s, I can only imagine what they’re doing behind the scenes now. The industrial secrets that Oatly must possess are probably ascended. They’re probably using sentient fucking AI to reverse engineer the genome of oats. Quantum computers to run advanced algorithmic research. Bullish.

## Oat Metaverse

Oat Metaverse

## Hipster Aware Marketing

Oatly has a Bandcamp page with remix stems available for producers. This is marketing 2.0-  There is an acapella track performed by the CEO here. what ceo even does that? Lol so relatable to my genz sensibilities. Oatly seeing massive retail expansion across the states. Massive addressable market.  24/7 oatly ceo slowed + reverb lofi beats to study to

## quirked up oatmilk shawty gf

this is the vibe shift. I wrote this DD on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009). bullish on quirky post-millennial core stocks. my ADHD never lies folks.

# in conclusion

not investment advice but buy the stock while its cheap- at a support level rn. also to the bagholders that got burned from the IPO- green days  are coming soon. just DCA.

""“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.”

- /u/ControlTheNarrative""

- Warren Buffett

Look, we all know US and 'gyna have become ensnared in an economic cold war. 

What most people don't realize is that everything's gonna be alright. Mutually assured economic destruction is in our favor here.

Two stats you may find intriguing:

>TSLA mkt cap: $2,857 per US citizen.

>NIO mkt cap: $36 per Chinese citizen


Everyone is asleep at the wheel here. Forget the fact that Elon Musk is the modern day equivalent of Thomas Edison on acid, a relatively lucid/sober Nikola Tesla, John Rockefeller, and the most autistic friend you have. NIO posted $5 billion in sales in 2021 for 187% YoY growth. The stock is trading at 10x revenues right now despite doubling sales two years in a row.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NIO/nio/revenue

... and their EPS is only -$0.05/share. 


China has 1.4 billion people. If just 5% of them own a Nio vehicle in 10 years, that will have been $2.8 Trillion in sales. Trillion.

tl;dr buy TSLA always...

But also buy NIO, because this stock will 20x over the next 5 years. TSLA stock will not.",1639636939.0

Visa’s board approved 12 billion additional funds for share repurchase, bringing the total available approved funds to 13.2 billion.

$V is a solid play. Profitable business model, good history of market defense (despite losing some market share to others), and growing addressable market. 

With transactions increasing due to on-premise cash acceptance down trending (existing trend + pandemic trend), and online shopping trending higher… business looks strong in the mid term.

Shares were undervalued after a correction from July’s high down to 190-200.

Planning to pick up more shares, maybe a couple calls

# Wtf is a Cyxtera?

Cyxtera is a datacenter colocator founded in 2017. In other words, they help maintain and store your data so you can quickly, reliably, and efficiently watch any selection of the archives of poon that you uploaded on the cloud. Other companies in the space include Equinix, DigitalOcean, CoreSite, etc. 

 

# Paper is cheap AF

This is stock is cheaper than I am during a Flea market visit after Black Friday. Cyxtera IPO'd through a spac merger, which is why I think it's relatively under the radar. And by relatively, I mean completely unknown. There hasn't been a single mention of it on WSB. ~~The price at 10.60 is still super close to the NAV price of $10 dollars and the MC is sitting around 1.7 B.~~ Whoops, I procrastinated and the price is now 11.34 atm. mb. Doesn't change the fact that Im bullish AF.

But I think we can definitely infer that big investors/a lot of investors are liking the stock. Cyxtera just had 2 PR events (if you read my MTTR dd, you know how much I like PR), that occurred on  [12/1 and 12/6](https://ir.cyxtera.com/events-and-presentations/). Following those, there is a sudden spike in buying interest and stock price. That's just my guess, so take it with a grain of salt.

Here are a few comparisons with company MC, Revenue, P/E ratios.

&#x200B;

|Company|Mkt Cap|Revenue|P/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cyxtera|1.72 Billion|177 M|Current Net Loss|
|Equinix|73.3 Billion|1,700 M|172|
|CoreSite|7.5 Billion|164 M|82|
|Digital Realty|47.7 Billion|1,110 M|70|

Cyxtera is currently operating at net revenue loss. I can't hide that fact. If you're gonna get some, you'll probably be holding it for a while, but I do see a lot of upside with the company. They're currently working with [Nvidia](https://ir.cyxtera.com/news/news-details/2021/Cyxtera-Supports-NVIDIA-Inception-Program-for-Technology-Startups/default.aspx)'s inception members (a bunch of tech startups funded by/supported by N f-ing Vidia ) and also with Nutanix and [Intel](https://ir.cyxtera.com/news/news-details/2021/Nutanix-Collaborates-with-Cyxtera-Intel-and-Other-Industry-Leading-Technology-Partners-to-Launch-Federal-Innovation-Lab/default.aspx) on the Federal Innovation Labs.

The Nvidia inception imo is a great way to get more exposure to up and coming companies that are already funded (at least to some degree) by Nvidia. These are predominantly ML/AI companies. If any of yall know about that field, the amount of data and storage needed to train and test models is ridiculous. All that is just gonna be profit for Cyxtera in the future.  

The Nutanix/Intel partnership is no laughing matter either. IT'S FOR THE GOVERNMENT. ask the pltards, they LOVE when companies work with the government.

# TA:

Tbh. I don't really know wtf im doing in this section. But I learned somewhere higher lows and higher highs is a good thing. and I think that's what I'm seeing? The 3 month chart on this looks beautiful. lol correct me if I'm wrong. cuz I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I just know you draw dots and connect them.

8519,Now is the time to buy cruise stock! Huge discount!!,rh526q,"Carnival CCL and Norwegian NCLH are stupid cheap right now. Yes, Covid is scary but let me explain just how discounted these stocks are. Breaking it down so simple that even your bastard ape brain toddler can understand it. 

CCL’s total liabilities are $38.75B. Their total assets are $53.51B. If you subtract their total assets from their total liabilities you get $14.76B. That means if CCL closed up shop and sold all their ships and other assets, they would still make $14.76B dollars! Their current Market Cap is only $20.49B! If you believe that the cruise industry will completely fail, go bankrupt and sell all their assets, then it is valued correctly. If you believe the cruise industry is coming back, then this is stupid cheap! All signs are not only pointing to cruising coming back, they are expecting it to grow next year. 2022 bookings are already higher then 2019 bookings!


For those thinking, “well cruise lines took on a lot of debt”, let’s break that down. CCL’s net debt is $24.08 billion (total debt $31.23B minus cash $7.15B). Their total assets are $53.51 billion. That gives them a debt ratio of .58 (which is very good). Average debt ratio for the airline industry is more then double at 1.1562. So debt, really isn’t an issue. 

For those worried about Omicron, all preliminary reports have actually been positive in the sense that it’s not as severe as Delta. Chances of hospitalization or death are, so far, very low. On top of that, boosters provide protection. Even better, Pfizer just announced they have developed the first highly effective treatment to Covid. The pills they developed are 90% effective! That’s a game changer that can actually put an end to the pandemic! It will almost completely reduce the severity of Covid. Hospitals will finally be back to normal and Covid will now be no worse then a common cold with these treatments. 

Last bit of advice to remember is that the most money to be made is when things go from terrible to ok. Not ok to good. 

If NCLH and CCL stock prices go back to just what they were earlier this year, that’s over a 60% gain! If the stock price went back to 2 years ago, precovid, then you would triple your returns (although that’s not likely soon but maybe in the long term). If they just get back to what they were near the height of delta 6 months ago, that’s over 60% gains!",1639591111.0

If they tank, I’d be completely surprised since they are one of the largest builders. I work in the lending industry, and the builders are so bloated with sales that they refuse outside lenders flat out right now and offer no incentives if you go to a build site with an outside prequalification form. Guidance might make it a challenge with supply chains, but they are booking and closing homes on dirt lots, so it’s not a matter of if they’ll sell. I should warn you: Lennar has a history of making profits and then tanking the next morning, but the day after it moons. If this happens, I’ll sell my puts and go in on more calls tomorrow.
We could also see some downward pressure from the fed meeting today if rates are going up, but it appears this is being priced in already.

Below are my positions currently:

* LEN $130 Call $0.08 > 12/17 Exp · 22 Buys
* LEN $115 Call $1.35 > 12/17 Exp. 5 Buys 
* LEN $110 Call $3.25 > 12/17 Exp. 2 Buys
* LEN $111 Put $3.40 > 12/17 Exp: 1 Buy
* LEN $108 Put $1.98 > 12/17 Exp · 1 Buy

**Edit to show current status**

[looks like tendies are back on the menu boys!](https://ibb.co/8BNYBzc)

**Edit to discuss losses**

Lennar missed on er. Truly shocking considering every other builder has killed it. Oh well. Thankfully, I played it safe with betting. I invested 3900 into calls and puts. Losing about 1400 tomorrow from Friday calls expiring close to worthless, but I’m also gaining 1900 in puts, ended up buying more when I looked at risk end of day. 

I’m still up technically because I have January calls I paid nothing for. I bought all these before IV crush.  I meant to get more puts because I was unbalanced on my hedging, but I was ok losing half of it happened to tank. Somehow I’ll be ok.  As long as we don’t go sideways 😩

# KEY POINTS

* Similar setup to Dec ‘19-Jan ‘20 rebound (1mo return \~+45%)
* Analyst EBITDA estimates too low; avg PT of $70! (+85%)
* Explosive ’22 EBITDA growth on increased op leverage
* Consistent 2022 Top Pick on Street; screens great for fund managers
* CEO bought 200k shares, major vote of confidence
* Wandered desert for '21, Entering promised land '22
* Calls priced for good upside!

# Company Description

Uber is best known for its B2C ridesharing platform, but the variety of logistic-based businesses under its umbrella drive the company's full value. This includes B2B businesses like Uber Freight, which in ‘21 acquired Transplace- a global leader in logistics and supply chain management software- during the early innings of a historic transformation in both industries. Additionally, in markets where Uber could not compete immediately (i.e. China) they invested in leading regional startups (i.e. Didi), allowing them to still profit from the global transportation & logistics transformation while gaining optionality through simple strategic sales. Uber has also developed subscription and loyalty programs, locking in their customer base while taking market share. Best of all, they’re also ramping a high-margin advertising business, practically printing free money from businesses looking to be promoted on their super app. A consistently smart, strategic approach has made Uber one of the great companies to come out of the 2010s tech boom.

# Thesis

UBER has been getting hammered nearly all of 2021 for various reasons, none of which are due to fundamental shifts in the business. It's a far stronger company than pre-covid, as the pandemic era forced Uber to increase efficiency & financial leverage, making them **more profitable on lower bookings**. **Return to full volume = Profits like Splash Waterfalls** (see: Ludacris). Did I mention the CEO just said they had their **best bookings week ever**? Additionally, they should benefit from travel news over the next month as it continues to see strong recovery momentum despite Omicron.

Two important calendar events happen annually: Entering the new year and the second half. Funds are always for stocks to drive outperformance in that next period, and in the case of Dec, this leads to supply overhangs from tax-loss harvesting (TLH) suddenly being met with swift buying once the “coast is clear”. Like the overhang in ‘19, Uber could rebound out of this period toward the mid-to-high 40s where the CEO purchased 200k shares last month. Market mechanics converging with positive fundamental news should support a near-term multiple rerating.

Recap: This play is taking advantage of a rebound as the coast clears from overwhelming Dec supply (TLH & omicron fears), buying demand re-enters (week of 12/17) helping it break its downward channel, and a sentiment & technical reversal is signaled, leading to further upside momentum.

# Current Valuation & Financials

* Revenue Growth: +49% ’22, +31% ‘23
   * Fwd P/S '22: 2.9x ... valuation and growth speak for themselves. Name one other company growing at \~40% 2yr CAGR trading at only 2.9x Fwd P/S.
* EBITDA Growth: +243% ‘22, +188% ‘23
   * Explosive growth a direct result of prior investments across their platforms
   * Does not yet account for CEO’s comments on 12/14 reaffirming 4Q21 EBITDA toward the higher end of the guide (orig: $25m-$75m), which likely flows through to slight estimate raises across the next calendar year as well.
   * Uber continues to approach full profitability, currently estimated for Q2 ’23. I suspect Uber may pull this expectation forward at their Feb ER.
* Free Cash Flow Growth: ’22 +190%, ’23 +268%
   * UBER’s efficiency initiatives have it on the brink of becoming a colossal FCF generation machine, with ’22 expected to be the year they flip FCF positive for the first time in history. Guess what factor should do well in the next phase of this market? My money is increasing FCF will be top of that list.
* Equity Investments
   * The primary culprit of their Q3 miss, equity investment revaluation (i.e. Didi stake of 144mil shares) drove the bulk of their -$2.4B net income loss, not losses from actual business operations.
   * CEO looking to strategically raise cash from these investments as they rebound in the future; with Didi relisting on Chinese markets, it will eventually flow through as a colossal earnings tailwind in the future.
* Analyst Price Target: $69.50, +86% Upside
   * The buffer makes it a fantastic candidate to rebound and still have plenty of upside following their February ER.
   * **UBER named a Top 2022 Pick by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS so far.** What do all these have in common? They comprise the bulk of investable assets and represent a significant portion of sell-side flow. Good PMs drive outperformance by buying early in a price turnaround and that’s roughly where we are.

# Technicals

Technicals are horrific due to the relentless nature of the TLH in Q4 as managers offset insanely strong gains elsewhere. However, 2020’s resistance level of $37 has become the new support during the December selling and it is very clearly basing; once the TLH subsides this week, we should have a quick zip upward, officially breaking the upper channel of the downtrend, in turn triggering positive momentum signals which leads to fast money re-entering the stock. See Chart 1 in Appendix

# How to Play

Note: All positions assume a rebound to mid-to-high $40s by expiration. Prices as of posting (12/15). Prior resistance highs were $64.

*Gen X/Boomers*: Buy stock! No brainer.

*Risk-Averse*: April ’22 C42.5 currently presents 1-3x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.

*Quasi-Risk Averse*: March ’22 C42.5 currently presents 3.9x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.

*Pump It Up! Junior*: Feb '22 C45 currently presents 4.7x upside on a post-ER rebound to $50, expands to 9.5x on a rebound to $55, 85% of prior highs.

*Pump It Up!*: Jan ’22 C40 currently presents 5.5-9x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s

*WSB Delight*: Jan ’22 C42 currently presents 6.5-11x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s

&#x200B;

My positions (12/15): I’m accumulating all of the above, finishing my purchasing over the days ahead as we take advantage of volatility from options expiration and the market holding its breath through the Fed announcement. Instead of posting this write-up on Dec expiration (12/17) as planned, I decided to crank it out earlier due to the attention boost UBER got 12/14 so people could start legging in positions. Keep in mind the current positioning of the options market should create a gravitational pull toward $40 into 12/17 expiration at the same time TLH starts to subside.

# Appendix

Regarding regulation, which I originally cut for length due to it not being relevant to this trade:

>I'm glad you mentioned that as I cut it out for length. As RBC stated in a recent report:  
>  
>*We view outcomes similar to Prop 22 in CA as more likely, where driver protections are put in place with an emphasis on those pursuing full-time driving which affects the minority of drivers.*  
>  
>As BTIG stated in a recent report titled ""UK Ruling More of a Win Than Headlines Suggest""*:*  
>  
>*UBER reclassified UK drivers as workers in 3/2021 and competitors didn't match, which meant that* ***UBER's costs \[already\] went up*** *...The net result should be... a level playing field... and finally a scenario in which UBER could raise prices to offset the higher costs... since the reclassification.*

**12/21/21 Update:** UBER showed great strength against 12/20's market-wide selling pressure, a signal that the supply overhang is behind us. With UBER near $42, the $42 strike now becomes the higher gamma play with the 45s being the higher upside play. Given that TLH is generally over and with the Santa Claus rally in play, UBER definitely looks ready to break out of its downtrend channel with a higher probability bursting toward high $40s to $50 by Jan expiration (where it currently has 150k OI on C50, which will either be a wall or an accelerant depending on how quickly it gets there).

Given recent strength, I made the following rotations:

* 100% of Jan 40s into UBER Jan 45s and another Jan effect play
* 50% of my UBER Jan 42s into Jan 45s
* 100% of March 42.5s into March 47.5s
* Still holding April 42.5s (best reward/risk on run to $55)

As mentioned in the thread & comments, I had owned every suggested position as they offered the highest return/risk based on my proprietary excel model, and all remaining UBER positions still offer great upside into the month ahead as UBER approaches its breakout.

&#x200B;

**12/23/21 Update:** After UBER's strength was called out on CNBC's Fast Money today, this will bring additional attention and flows to the stock. The broad market (S&P) remains supportive as it lifts higher, and itself likely makes a sustained break above Q4 resistance (~4700) into Jan. Both of these factors are supportive of a full breakout for UBER. Still targeting high 40s/50 by Jan expiration (4wks away), especially as the required average daily move to reach $50 has dropped to +0.60%.

Current option positioning supports a gravitational pull toward $50 on continued momentum (currently 150K Jan C50 OI); depending on how quickly that strike is approached, that OI would also create a small MM hedging lift on a break above $50.

I've completely exited the Jan 40s and 42s and rolled to Jan 45s which offered over 3x returns on a run to $50.",1639575926.0

8733,"IONQ is the future, here's why",rgyhfs,"FD: I personally own 2200 shares at $16.01

TL;DR Right now gate fidelity and error correction ""overhead"" are not just important, they are the only relevant stat for Quantum Computer (QC) comparisons. IONQ has recently made two announcements that put them at a level that is truly scalable and on the road to QCs superior to classical computers, (which equals big $$$).

I might be preaching to the choir here, but I really wanted to write something to drive home the importance of IONQ's two major announcements over the last two months and why IONQ is going to take off and make investors rich one day. 

1. A 9:1 error correction ratio 
2. Using Barium-133 to achieve 99.98% gate fidelity.

First, I would encourage everyone to go to IONQ's website and use the Algorithmic Qubit (AQ) calculator in order to see for themselves what this is about by playing with some of the numbers. Second, I pose a question: Let's say IONQ issued a press release tomorrow saying they came out with a 128 qubit system using their same technology on the 32 qubit system, 99.90% gate fidelity, 16:1 error correction  (which was still superior to competitors). Would you be excited? How much more powerful or useful do you think it would be? Trick question, it would be exactly the same! It turns out that you would need 369 physical qubits to achieve just ONE more usable AQ (from 22 to 23).

Now I want to remind you that a QC's ability is measured as 2^N power, meaning one additional AQ doubles the ability. As you might see though, adding qubits painstakingly increases the actual usability. Now, let's take that hypothetical 128 qubit system and add 9:1 error correction with 99.98% gate fidelity, as is achieved with Barium-133. The AQ jumps to 51! That means it's not just double the power, it's the power doubled 29 more times! Just .08% improvement in gate fidelity did all that. As the numbers scale up, the error correction will be much more important, but right now, it's all about gate fidelity. 

When we get qubit systems around 400, we start to see a 9:1 error correction come into play. At that point, they start to have the same exponential effect as gate fidelity. As it turns out, with no other technological improvements, IONQ will need only to reach 630 qubits for broad quantum advantage at 70 AQs. This will be achieved in 3 years, at the latest, given their roadmap (which they are currently well ahead of). In fact, the biggest issue is going to be software developers catching up to the hardware, which is opposite the situation we typically find in current classical computing. 

In closing, gate fidelity isn't everything, it's the only thing right now. IBM is boasting a 127 qubit system. As I have demonstrated here, that's meaningless. A 0.08% increase in fidelity? GAME-CHANGING! Later on, an error correction using just 9 physical qubits as ""overhead"" will allow massive scale. In 5 years, these advances will allow for a 113 AQ system that isn't just superior to supercomputers, but is mind-bendingly superior (remember 2^N). IONQ has actually already done the hard lifting and is well on its way to making usable QCs a reality, and sooner than many thought possible 3 months ago.",1639572935.0

8759,Federal Reserve Day - My predictions on Powell's moves - 7 hours 30 minutes countdown!,rgx1qg,"In response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last\_minute\_predictions\_does\_powell\_crash\_or\_soar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last_minute_predictions_does_powell_crash_or_soar/) :)

First let's take a step back and analyse the world logically and with facts.

1. The Fed has 2 priorities: (1) Maximum employment (2) Price Stability and low inflation. Everything else is secondary.
2. Markets have priced in a 2x taper by March ish, a 2-3 rate hike in 2022.
3. Omicron hasn't caused lockdowns YET, except it most likely will due to the 2x transmisibility. Although Omicron is 90% less severe, and vaccines still work 70-75% for hospitalisations, Omicron is a wildcard. The International Energy Agency predicted a reduced demand for oil due to Omicron as well just a few days back.
4. Pfizer's 89% pill's final data is reasonable. Possible FDA approval end of year.
5. Maximum employment seems to have been reached since 4.2% (4.5% expected) unemployment was seen. Participation rate is 61.8%, still lower than pre COVID (63.3%), but it's recovering. Jobless claims (ie unemployment benefits) was 2x less than expected, although this seems to be expected since unemployment was lower than expected.
6. CPI inflation was as expected - 6.8%. PPI sadly was higher than expected 9.6% (9.2% expected). CPI's main culprit was gas prices and used car prices. Gas prices seem to be subsiding. Used car prices are mostly due to the chip shortage. PPI was due to an increase in demand for goods and services. Gas / oil prices actually reduced.
7. The UK has declared an emergency for Omicron, and will possibly boost everyone quickly until the end of the year. Australia's Omicron cases are skyrocketting due to a recent superspreader event with 150 people infected.
8. China showed higher than expected inflation, yet retail sales was lower than expected.
9. The yield curve was not very nice after Omicron, and before inflation, but it seems to have recovered. In fact, recently, the long term yields seem to be going up rather.
10. The debt ceiling was just passed (Senate 50 v 49, House 221 v 209) a few hours ago and will now be signed by Biden. It essentially delays the issue until early 2023 or late 2022.
11. The put/call ratio for major indices (CBOE) has declined somewhat, except it's still around 141 puts v 100 calls. On Dec 10 during the Inflation day it was a whopping 204 puts v 100 calls. On PPI day (PPI higher than expected), it was 141 v 100.

|Date / Event|Puts v 100 Calls (SP500 Index)|Puts v 100 Calls (total equity ie individual stocks)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|23 Tue Nov|146|53|
|24 Wed Nov (Jobless claims 50% less) (Omicron first discovered)|**178**|50|
|25 Thurs Nov (Thanksgiving)|HOLIDAY|HOLIDAY|

|6 Mon Dec|153|54|
|7 Tue Dec|168|43|
|8 Wed Dec|148|45|
|9 Thu Dec (Jobless less than expected again)|158|53|
|10 Fri Dec (Inflation better than expected)|**204**|61|
|13 Mon Dec (First UK Omicron death, emergency declared)|**189**|56|
|14 Tue Dec (PPI worse than expected) (Pfizer 89%)|141|60|
|15 Wed Dec (Debt Ceiling passes, FOMC)|||

The table does show a consistent long term high put to call ratio. Inflation Day and FOMC Monday saw elevated 200 puts v 100 calls. Now it has subsided to 141 puts to 100 calls. It's still relatively high though, except it has subsided.

For updated Fed probabilities from CME:

|December|2022|97.24|97.71|97.96|
|February|2023|97.93|98.31|98.45|

**My conclusions:**

1. First if Omicron didn't exist, Powell would be pretty strict, and may even say a 4x rate hike. This is because PPI was higher than expected, and CPI is on point. Likewise, unemployment is at a all time low, and jobless claims are very low.
2. But here comes Omicron into the mix - Omicron will further exacerbate supply chain issues, cause unemployment to once again tick up (if lockdowns are seen), and will cause some mayhem. Possibly even a dent in consumer demand. Likewise the International Energy Agency forecast a drop in demand for oil due to Omicron, most likely due to decreased travelling and transportation.

Due to Omicron, in my view, if you look at the world logically, the Fed will still taper x2 speed. Maybe even slightly faster. Most likely 2x. Omicron will be with us for 3 months at least (the US only has just started so Jan, Feb, March ish). This most likely the Fed will NOT raise rates in Jan and March, and will raise rates in May due to Omicron subsiding. Maybe even in June, since April / May might be recovering from Omicron. Then another rate hike in July is possible. Then finally November. Maybe even December, but unlikely.

**IMO Powell will most likely say ""We'll adjust our policy decisions as we see fit because Omicron will cause disruptions to the economy, as seen in Europe. This will impact full employment and price stability. However, inflation seems to be elevated for longer than expected, with Omicron further exacerbating the issue, and so we believe a 2x taper until March is necessary.""**

**I doubt he'll mention any IR increases, but in the dot plot, it'll show at least 3 IR hikes ie around May/June, July, November. Unlikely March, since March will show the full wrath of Omicron. I'm most worried about a December 2022 rate hike!**",1639567908.0
8760,RIOT's Recovery,rgx1od,"Dear Elite Investors,

As the smartest people on Wall Street/Main Street you can now see that the stock market faces headwinds in the form of Jerome Powell endless money printing, overheating from the OCT/NOV run and tax loss harvesting that will continue through the end of the year. 

Let's talk about how to see crazy gains, or at least reasonable ROI in the new year. I recently put what was left from Options gambling addiction into RIOT Blockchain. I fully understand that this sub is not for the discussion of B$%C$#N and would never want to soil WSB's good name, but this is a NASDAQ traded company with a lot of upside in the next 3-6 months. 

RIOT is a real company that is nearing profitability

RIOT holds the largest B$%C$#N mining facility in the US and successfully mined 466 coins in November equating to a 298% increase  over the same period in November. The also ESS Metron to further build their market share and establish their position as the one of the two largest B$%C$#N mining operations in the US (The other being Marathon Digital Holdings)

Most important is that for 2021RIOT mined 3387 coins at a total cost of $10096 per coin which is a getting lower as they become the most energy efficient mining operation in the business. This efficiency improved by 5% over the previous quarter. With a recent $600m raise the cash on hand alone raises the value of the company by 50% and those funds are being deployed to further lower the cost/coin mined. 

The total net loss for Q3 was just $15.3M which bodes well as B$%C$#N is projected to hit $100k in the next 12 months and the cost to mine is falling. Rockdale, Texas has pulled out all the stops to keep energy costs low and mining being based in Texas will shield RIOT from Green New Deal initiatives as much of the Texas Grid is already on renewables.

Technical Analysis

[WSJ Price Target suggest 116&#37; based on current price target](https://preview.redd.it/p5xaiohnwo581.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b54433b2b7c9d0e2978c51b38f8f75f1c04528)

RIOT is showing strong support at the $24 range and with the high price targets on Wall Street, it is extremely like that institutional and retail funds roll back into RIOT once we hit January. This is based on current B$%C$#N prices, if B$%C$#N goes to new ATHs the price action should accelerate. 

&#x200B;

Bottom line: This stock is set to double in the next year if B$%C$#N stays steady or even dips a little more, if B$%C$#N goes to the $100k projection for 2022, we could see RIOT go 4x over 12 months

8832,Why Bumble ($BMBL) is a dying app,rgsszu,"As a professional horny 23 M, I feel like I have perfect perspective on the app Bumble. Let’s do a dive into why it’s a dying app.

1)It’s in a very crowded field with a dominant competitor, Tinder, who has all the branding and cultural significance. When people think “dating app” it’s almost always Tinder, Bumble does not come to mind first. It comes in a group with the “others” a la Hinge, Match, eHarmony, Coffee Meets Bagel etc

2) The “unique” feature of Bumble, in theory is a cool idea, but in practice is nothing but a formality. I’m talking about how the female has to send the first message. Anyone who has used the app can attest to the fact the 99% of the first messages from females is “hey”, putting it back on the guy to “really start” the conversation. 

3) What corner of the market does Bumble posses? Tinder has the major share of the market as the hook up or “seeing what’s out there” app. Hinge has the market for serious relationships for 20-30 year olds. Match and eHarmony are for everyone older. Bumble doesn’t stick out, is it a hook up app? Or a serious app?

4) Bumble BFF, pretty straightforward on this. If you’re a gay man, Grindr already exist for your needs. There’s well established swinger apps, so swingers ain’t gonna be using this. If you’re actually looking for friends, go out to a bar or a park, idk but Bumble BFF ain’t it gonna be the way to find friends

5) Bumble’s interface is terrible, it is childish and attracts some real odd folks

TLDR: Bumble is a basic app in a very crowded. Plus the new “Bumble BFF” is just closeted gays (nothing wrong with that, but not intended use) and couples looking for a third",1639550497.0

8875,🍆 DICKS sporting goods 🍆 - Undervalued and ready to go,rgrqoy,"I'm not the most technical kind of guy, I try find quality valuations in reputable companies. Dick's is a stock that popped on my radar that I'm going to continue buying, given both it's valuation, unique retail market, profitability per store, and most of all, share price that's low and should be a lot higher.

$DKS

Trades around 8-9 PE currently, has grown earnings on average, 15% annually, for the last 5 years. Even if it maintains just a 10% earnings growth rate in coming years, that's still amazing. I'm not going to downplay supply chain issues, however they do exist for every retailer, so let's ignore them for now.

They also have very low debt to cash ratio, about 5$ for every 1$ of debt.


They're trading at about a 0.5 Price to Earnings growth (PEG), which suggests 20% returns annually at current valuations, if they can maintain the 15% growth rate they've accomplished in the past 5 years. Even if they can't, and sales are cut in half for to supply chains and people not wanting sporting goods (unlikely), that's 10% share price growth annually, maintaining a valuation of 8 PE.

It's also trading near the bottom, where it could bounce back about 20%-30%, which it's fallen from a month ago. It's fallen too fast, and the earnings it put out were above consensus.

I'll upload photos later, I can't now because I'm taking a big shit, where I do my best thinking.  My suggestion is buying a lot on margin. It's what I've been doing and will continue to do if it approaches 100$ further. I'm so far in around 7k

But every single person I have met that owns a Tesla absolutely loves the car but has run into some catastrophic failure of the car in some form, yet, they still absolutely love it.

I will list a work colleague and my uncle's experience with their model 3s:

My Uncle:

Was driving down his neighborhood where some component failed, making the steering wheel useless and him driving off the road into a tree. Only 20 MPH but still fucked up.  After saying this part, he goes into a shpeel on how great the car is. Then, he admit that he still had to pay 3000 bucks to fix the problem that most likely could have killed or injured him if on the highway. Ok this sounds pretty boomerish, so let us go onto the young millenial. 

Work Friend:

Techy guy and absolutely loves the car. But one day his doors stopped working and he couldn't get inside, so he had to spend 20 minutes in the company parking lot to get the trunk open and crawl through the seats to the drivers seat lol.

Obviously, this is only 2 people, but would you guys agree that Teslas brand is so strong that it can overcome significant quality control of the product?",1639543503.0

Today tuesday December 14th:

SPY pre marker opened red with the anticipation of PPI numbers being released at 0830. And of course those numbers were released and big surprise worst than expected. 

https://i.imgur.com/FciARZ0.jpeg


https://i.imgur.com/rpggHw6.jpeg

As you can see leading up to PPI numbers pre market we had a clear support line (mind you downward). 1 hour RSI was relatively low at 31 with a downward sloping MACD. By all means it appeared we could see another sideways day or even a bullish recovery. 

But as usual market reacted extremely negatively to the news. On the daily we needed to hold support at the 20 day EMA of 463.61 in order to consolidate and prevent a major sell off. Once the 20 day EMA breaks its anticipated we see 50 day EMA (458.36). 

https://imgur.com/a/z35JlEs

Based off pre-market and PPI numbers i quickly picked up a Jan 18 460P that i was able to in and out scalp for 13% (keep in mind my goals to fry a bunch of fish at 10-20% gains  instead of massive 60% gains. Im trying to avoid the big losses). 

Immediately after selling my 460P i noticed a bounce incoming. 1 hour RSI began to curl up and MACD closed the gap. We had clear resistance waiting for us as the 1 hour 20 day EMA began to fall in line with the resistance line i had drawn. 

https://imgur.com/a/IzcdmKd

Picked up and sold a Dec 17 465C for another 12% gainer. 

Around 1045 it was clear that it was fixing to dip more. We had 3 candles all close near eachother (1 hour) on the resistance line. I was keeping an eye on the daily 20 day EMA for a support bounce after the small recovery. She did not bounce. Once it broke the 20 day i anticipated a move near the 50 day EMA of 459. 
https://i.imgur.com/XM4ODm2.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/pi5bt3k.jpeg

Another thing i watched all morning was the 1 hour bollinger band. We were using the mid as resistance and low as support all day. 
https://i.imgur.com/XWDKe5R.jpeg

I picked up another Feb 18 460P here that i was able to sell for another quick 10% gain. Based off the bollinger band and and an earlier drawn support line at the time i anticipated a 460 dip (but was prepared for 458 based off the daily EMA). Also as you can see there was a very clear gap that needed to be filled from 460-462 which made sense for it to correct to. 

https://imgur.com/a/TgvF7ht

From there it seemed we were going to retest the resistance line of the downward channel we had established. 1 hour 20 day EMA was still riding the resistance line i drew and was near 464.81. Unfortunately was busy and didnt get a chance to buy in when i wanted to but was still able to get a nice Feb 18  462C.  Realistically should have done 465C but i was worried we may reject at the daily 20 day EMA and not make it to 465. Was still able to scalp a 5% gain before it felt like the dip was coming again.

Overall not a bad day. 2 puts and 2 calls for an average of +10% per trade. I am still honing in my expiration dates and again being conservative knowing im leaving some gains on the table. The first put and call i probably coulda double my profit but closed quickly for a confirmed gain.

------‐-----------------------

December 14th Market close and December 15th outlook 

The last hour gave us a nice preview for tomorrow. she attempted with a hard run to break the downward channel but was unsuccessful. big rejection at resistance of 464.5. the 1 hour 20 day EMA, 1 hour mid Bollinger and daily mid bollinger all intersect there (lots of resistance). With a daily doji candle confirming uncertainty with an impending sell signal for the daily MACD could be pointing to further downtrend tomorrow with FOMC at 2pm tomorrow. Rumor is they are going to be much more aggressive than expected and will taper by March instead of end of 2022.

Aftermarket did show a small recovery but overall confirmed the downward channel failing any significant breakout. 

I believe tomorrow is going to be the catalyst for the year end correction. EVERYONE is calling for the ""santa rally"" but ive gotta say i dont think its coming. 

If we zoom out and look at this beautiful and clear channel we are in (mind you resistance is clear while ""support"" has been variable levels of correction)... we most recently had dipped in October to reconfirm the bottom support line. we had a small dip beginning of December to the middle of the channel. we just attempted to breakout to the top and was rejected. In general though the daily 150 day EMA has been the dead bottom of corrections.

https://i.imgur.com/Ugg3PxV.jpeg

i believe with the FOMC tomorrow and OPEX meeting friday we are going to see the full dip to the support line again (near the 150 day EMA) thatd put us right around 445 range. i think we are gonna see the market over correct and over react causing this dip (like it usually does) to 445 and will see a recovery back to the top resistance line near 480 (depending on quickness of the dip) as we enter the new year.
If you look at the daily MACD its about to show a sell signal and downward curling RSI is an indication we could see the final dip. RSI of 51 leaves plenty of room to dip to 445. I am also watching the daily bollinger bands which are currently sideways with a slight downward tilt. Lower band puts us at 452 and will drop as we drop confirming that 445 area. 

My play for tomorrow the 15th is a 460P for a quick 10-20% scalp and then wait to see how the day shakes out and exactly what JPOW says.

9077,How much of the Fed decision is already priced into the market?,rgl5ay,"The latest round of US inflation data has further cemented the likelihood that an increase in the rate of tapering will be announced after the FOMC meeting tomorrow, opening the door to an earlier rate hike. But how much of this expectation is already priced in?

The market seems to be almost certain of an extremely hawkish pivot, resulting in a decent amount of profit taking, particularly in tech. The NASDAQ is already down around 2% this week, trading near its 50-day EMA, as investors naturally expect growth stocks to suffer in this higher interest rate environment. However, if the Fed policy changes aren’t as aggressive as currently anticipated, buyers could see current prices as a good re-entry point.

Of course, monetary policy won’t influence the market in isolation. It needs to be looked at in the context of the central bank’s economic outlook for 2022. Should the Fed hold its current policy due to uncertainty surrounding Omicron's impact on the economy, we could see a fresh round of selling hit the market. 

All trading carries risk, so it will be important to fully understand everything that is said tomorrow before making any decisions.",1639526626.0

9293,The trade that will make the most money at the beginning of this year $XBI LONG JAN 14 118 C,rgf1b6,"XBI is a collection of biotech stocks.

biotech stocks are mainly driven by M&A, as deals by larger companies re-appraise the valuations of these stocks and by discount rate. 

XBI is down 35% from peak, a lot of it since November why, because of TAX LOSS HARVESTING.

PPl have lost so much in this piece of shit that they are getting rid of it to offset capital gains in other things hence the pressure you see here. 

When does tax loss selling end ? typically around 15 dec cf the nomura paper that just came out :  

>Besides funds getting stopped-out out popular positions, there is also a spike in a substantial “Tax Loss” selling dynamic, where as McElligott notes, historically the peak of “tax loss selling” season is 11/1 through mid-Dec, as evidenced by the Wolfe “Potential Tax Loss Selling Basket” -13.9% over that period, underperforming SPX (+1.4% since 11/1) by 15.3%; underperforming QQQ (+1.6% since 11/1) by 15.5%; and underperforming IWM (-5.3% since 11/1) by 8.6% 

XBI is at the lows and has ignored during this phase a slew of good news on the M&A front; PFE's latest acquisition at a 100% premium being the greatest example of how cheap the major pharmaceuticals think stocks in the field are right now. 

Once the pressure ends, i suspect this thing will BOOM UP to 140 in short order

Now the number one rule is that what's commonly agreed upon is almost never the answer, so you have to be creative in order to correctly call and time the market.

Powell can either cause circuit breakers to take out the power, or cause such a sign of relief that we reach new highs.

So we need to consider whether to expect Powell to increase the market, or to cause a decline.

He can easily bring us back up from the recent slump, but you need to be aware it could go in the opposite direction as well, a decrease.

You may be wondering why I basically repeated myelf in the last two-three paragraphs, that's because there's a character limit for discussion posts.

9323,I think Affirm ($AFRM) is in some trouble (DD),rge89w,"**The Introduction**

The 2008 financial crisis can be summed up as follows: banks believed that giving out loans with poor due diligence to shitty lenders was basically free money.

Then Affirm comes along and says, “Hold my beer”.

Affirm’s business model is simple. They allow you to make online purchases without having to pay upfront. By integrating with e-commerce platforms they make using their service seamless, which is great for their top-line. However, as we learnt from 2008, aggressively giving out loans isn’t free money. It’s a time-bomb.

&#x200B;

**The Data**

Let’s look at the data. A loan is considered delinquent if it is past due by more than 30 days. Here are Affirm’s delinquency rates. Some data is unavailable.

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Stimulus Cheques|\-|$1200|\-|$600|$1400|\-|\-|\-|

&#x200B;

Delinquency rates went down for Affirm between Q2 of 2020, and Q4 of 2020, and remained somewhat stable in Q1 2021. This was when people lost their jobs. So how were they paying back their loans? Stimulus cheques, of course. Once the cheques stopped Affirm’s share of bad loans started to spike, going from 2.4% to 5.3% in just 6 months.

Note that this number denotes delinquent loans as a % of loans held. It doesn’t refer to the number of shitty loans taken up during the period. Think of it this way: you have 10 apples, but 2 of them are rotten. Your rotten rate is 20%. Next day you get 10 more apples, of which 4 are rotten. Your rotten rate is now 30% (which is only about 50% higher than yesterday, even though you took on 100% more rotten apples today).

So, am I saying that the American economy is going to explode in an orgy of unpaid-for Lululemons bought by people who don't understand what debt is? I was hoping to find a similar trend in delinquency rates for credit card debt, but what I found was surprising:

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Delinquency Rates (Banks)|2.66%|2.43%|2.02%|2.11%|1.85%|1.58%|1.57%|\-|

&#x200B;

\* Source: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS)

In the time that Affirm’s delinquency rates went from 2.4% to 5.3% (an increase of 120%) banks saw their delinquency rates go down from 2.11% to 1.57% (a decrease of 25%). People are paying their personal debts. Just not to Affirm.

Here’s a table that might explain why the delinquency rate went up for Affirm:

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Credit score > 96|\-|71.04%|\-|74.69%|71.22%|66.20%|62.88%|\-|
|Credit score < 90 / no score|\-|0.26%|\-|0.31%|0.58%|0.66%|0.90%|\-|

&#x200B;

My educated guess: Affirm is taking on riskier loans to grow the top-line, and it’s starting to go south. Stimulus cheques delayed the fall.

My scandalous guess: Affirm is trying to grow the top-line at all costs to keep the share prices inflated, allowing executives and investors to make an exit before their retail shareholders learn to read financial statements.

&#x200B;

||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\-|3.30%|\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\-|
|Insider selling|\-|\-|\-|\-|$43m|\-|\-|$101m|
|Stock compensation|$7m|$5m|$6m|$6m|$140m|$135m|$93m|\-|

&#x200B;

Affirm had seen less insider selling than most other companies, with only $43m worth of shares sold in the last year. However, that changed in November 2021. Between 1st November and 1st December (just 30 days), insiders sold $101m worth of shares.

Needless to say the stock compensation shot up 2,300% (Q1 2021) when the trouble started brewing.

&#x200B;

**The Valuation**

Affirm has a ridiculous valuation. Since they don’t make a profit we can’t calculate their PE. The world of investing believes that tech companies can turn off their selling expenses at will, while maintaining their revenues, so the losses are transitory.

Affirm’s revenues for the year end 2021 were $870m. Let us assume their technology costs, selling expenses, and admin expenses were 75% less than actual numbers. Next, let us take a tax rate of 20%. This would give them a profit of $21m for the year.

That’s a PE of 1534. Affirm will have a PE of 1534 if they reduce their overheads by 75%. I don’t think a tech company has ever reduced their overheads by 75%. And this isn't even considering the inherent business risk explained above.

Who is still holding Affirm shares?

&#x200B;

**The Future**

The bulls will tell you Affirm is run by exceptionally talented and honest people who will turn Affirm into the next Microsoft, and every data point here is lying. When has corporate America ever fucked shareholders. Hopium is a hell of a drug.

Here is what I think will happen:

People start to notice the rise in delinquency rates, prompting Affirm to cut down on risky loans. They take a massive hit to their growth rate, and acknowledge the issue. People get flashbacks of 2008. Eye-popping growth rates are the only reason tech companies can trade at such high valuations. With that gone, Affirm’s stock will drop into a bottomless well, and $WISH will seem like a good investment.

&#x200B;

**How to Play This**

The market was already rotating from growth into value stocks as I wrote this, which means Affirm’s downfall could come sooner. However, I like to have a margin of safety and would recommend puts that are 1 or (ideally) 2 earnings away. I wouldn’t shy away from far OTM puts since the stock will drop really far once people truly realize the risk here.

December 2022 puts $30 puts were recently sold for $0.89. Defensive investors can aim for a higher strike price. Analysts have given Affirm a target price of $161. I give Affirm a fair target price of $2.75, if they can cut down their overheads. Needless to say, no one will be hiring me as an analyst anytime soon.

I had my thesis about Affirm in **November 2021**, and bought some puts then. I only decided to write this DD recently. I am planning to load up on more puts.

My position from November:

9437,Fisker $FSR (NYSE:FSR) Valued at $7.8b or $26.2 per share,rgbihu,"

Fisker (NYSE:FSR) is an Electrical Vehicle company. Directed by Mr. Henrik Fisker, they are primarily focused on designing and bringing **affordable autos to market quicker than traditional developers**.

The reason I chose Fisker is that I feel that the company’s business model is flexible enough to change with the times. Fisker initially sacrifices margins but allows for high capacity production, and it is led by the co-founders as opposed to professional managers.

Valuation Report:  
[https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/fisker-nysefsr-valuation-report?r=qm3pq&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/fisker-nysefsr-valuation-report?r=qm3pq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

In my view, the company will make around $26b in 2031 and will have a 6% EBIT margin, but lower than the EV market leader Tesla.  
  
The free cash flows to the firm will come significantly later in the life-cycle, around 2030 - 2031.  
  
I expect Fisker to be a value adding company with a Cost of Capital of 6.3% vs a Return on Invested Capital of 16%.  
  
The biggest risk for Fisker, will be market demand. The company can ramp-up production and include external partners, however, people have not heard of the brand, and the direct-to-consumer sales strategy may not be enough to convince them to buy.  
  
Investment timing should be ideally restricted up to Q3 2022, after which news coverage is expected to heavily increase. Investors should slowly add to their initial position if management delivers on operating income.",1639500209.0

9467,Producer Price Index worse than expected 9.6% v 9.2% + Updated Federal Reserve probabilities + Pfizer 89% pill,rgazg4,"The premarket actually was slightly positive.

Except when the [PPI data was released 8:30AM ET](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/wholesale-prices-measure-rises-9point6percent-in-november-from-a-year-ago-the-fastest-pace-on-record.html), it was worse than expected (9.6% v 9.2%). Gas prices did do down, EXCEPT the culprit was services and goods demand. This generally means services has increased more to the norm than expected, and people are buying tonnes of stuff.

Fortunately, Pfizer's pill is still [89% effective](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/effectiveness-pfizers-covid-pill-confirmed-analysis-company-says-rcna8662) to prevent death on their final blinded trial. However, it's now only 70% effective to reduce symptons, which is still reasonable, since Merck had a reduction of 50 to 30% for preventing death. The FDA should hopefully approve the pills by the end of the year.

Due to PPI, Omicron and Pfizer, the Federal Reserve's rate hike probabilities from [CME](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html#) have been updated from since [last time I reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfj37x/wednesday_federal_reserve_meeting_rate_hike/):

|Month|Year|Chance of Rate Hike (14 Dec)|Chance of Rate Hike (15 Dec)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|December|2021|1.11|**3.32**|
|January|2022|8.46|8.12|

9500,Revenue to shit by 50% - RKT put for 500% gain,rgacs7," 

**Interest rate hike**

First signal is the expected interest rate hikes, at least a few times in 2022. We are talking about a couple to a dozen. Unfortunately RKT relies heavily on refi. In fact, in the latest conference, CEO even admitted that half of the business is ""rate sensitive"" (see seeking alpha) - it's a nice way of saying, if the rate is going up, we **will lose half of our business**. Most of the people who want to get refi , even people would don't want to refi, have already done refi in the past 2 years when rate is almost zero. There are NO WAY people refi into a higher interest rate. RKT will be dumped every ER from here

**Do you see this headline about Zoom firing?**

Another signal comes from its competitor, [better.com](https://better.com/) . "" [The Better CEO who fired 900 people over a Zoom call](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827834/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-fired-900-people-zoom-time-off) "" . The headline in the media is on Zoom call, however, there is much bigger insight. Whoever ever signed up with [Better.com](https://better.com/) knows those folks call, email and text you day and night non-stop for at least 2 week straight, what is the accusation that they are slackers ? Think about it, [Better.com](https://better.com/) didn't fire all these people when housing was hot, why just now right before expected rate hike and the fed FOMC meeting? It's because the CEO know refi business is going to shit itself, so it needs to massively cut cost. There is no business will fire that many people in a hot cycle. RKT is on the same boat

Unlike the banking system which will benefit from rate hikes, RKT will lose its pants during hike increase. Better yet IV is low now that premium is cake. Easily put in this market.

Biotech company that markets TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO that is making absolute MOVES so far in what’s been a decent year for bitotechs. **All financial info has been taken from their most current investors call on 11/3/2021.**

· 6 billion in assets vs. 1.5 mill in debts. 

· Product review has increased 29% in the last year (Q3 2020 to Q3 2021)

o 2 out of their 5 main products increased massive amounts in review while the other 3 decreased but not significantly

· GAAP earnings per share has increased 30% over the last year, non-GAAP has increased 35%

Shoutout u/sizelordmatt & u/StonksOnlyGoUp1200 again for their original posts, I had thoughts about investing but these two sealed the deal for me.

Some links any potential investors might want to see.

9722,WMT will likely hit 100% Fib retrace.,rfze0r,"Today Wal-Mart continued to print green candles, despite a red day in the market. Inflation? Also good for Wal-Mart. Many people are fleeing companies with over inflated valuations to lower P/E companies that pay a dividend incase shit hits the fan, and WMT is one of them.

61.80 Fib = 142.41
100.00 Fib = 146.56

Finviz chart:

https://flic.kr/p/2mQAgS9

Shows it has recently double topped, but there's a W double bottom on the daily with room to run, which is also a bounce off of the 400ema. WMT is one of those companies that hates the 400ema and you can always depend on a bounce from there thanks to it's huge cash flows and boomer support. MACD crossed over today, and both RSI/MFI ramping up. 

WeBull chart:

https://flic.kr/p/2mQDB9w

With earnings and dividend payment behind us, the Christmas rally, inflation, and another earnings ahead we may just see a new ATH soon. 

Only concerning thing is the insider selling the last few months has been heavy. But where there is a seller, there are buyers who want these shares as much as the Waltons need to pay taxes. Even though there has been selling since June it still managed to get to a new ATH. 

Selling:

https://flic.kr/p/2mQz4jy

There was also a 2.5m share purchase AH and bullish flow on the options chain. FOMC meeting Wednesday will likely have little effect on WMT either way, and I'm sure gamma is pretty pumped up right now. I wouldn't be surprised to see 147-148 this week.

My positions:

Open: 8 x 142c 12/23 (purchased 12/10) 
Open: 2 x 145c 01/21/22 (purchased 12/09)

https://flic.kr/p/2mQDPX2

I had some other calls that were ITM I sold today and Friday to realize some gain and roll them forward. I may pick up a few 145c for 12/17 tomorrow for a swing, and add some 01/21 on dips if bullish sentiment remains.

9746,"FED Will Hike Rates In July, A 2nd Time In November, And A Third In Jan 2023. Here Is How I Know",rfy1y4,"For those of you that don't know, there is a way to calculate the probability of the FED raising their benchmark rate and what time they plan to do so as implied by market participants. Here is the PDF in case any of you want some reading material [link](https://www.economics-finance.org/jefe/fin/KeaslerGoffpaper.pdf). 

To give you all a brief summary, the equation to calculate the probability is this: 

(Effective federal fund implied by future contracts - Current federal fund rate) / (Federal fund rate assuming rate hike - Current federal fund rate)

Effective federal fund implied by future contracts = 100 - current future price

Current federal fund rate and fund rate assuming a hike is the midpoint of the current fed range and the midpoint of the fed range assuming a rate hike. So if the current range is 0 - 0.25%, then the current federal fund rate is 0.125%. 

You can find where I got my numbers from here: 

[link](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/stirs/30-day-federal-fund.quotes.html)

**May 2022**  

(0.24 – 0.125) / (0.375 – 0.125)

= 46%

**July 2022**

(0.355 – 0.125) / (0.375 – 0.125)

= 92%  \*\**This means a 0.25% rate hike is guaranteed by July.* 

**August 2022**

(0.42 – 0.375) / (0.625 – 0.375)

=18% \*\* *2nd rate hike unlikely to happen in august*  

**October 2022**

(0.53 – 0.375) / (0.625 – 0.375)

=62% \*\* *over 60% chance a second rate hike is coming fall of 2022*

**November 2022**

(0.595 – 0.375) / (0.625 – 0.375)

=88% \*\* *Second rate hike is almost guaranteed to happen by November*

**January 2023**

(0.74 – 0.625) / (0.75 – 0.625)

0.92 \*\* *Third rate hike is guaranteed by January of 2023*

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr:** Market priced in at least 2 rate hikes in 2022. One in early summer and another by late fall with the chance (albiet a small one) of a third hike in 2022. The third January 2023 rate hike is guaranteed. This means market already priced in interest rate increases and a slowdown in QE. Whatever Powell says on Wednesday is highly unlikely to impact the stock market in any material way because a more hawkish FED is expected.",1639452614.0

$SDC has been losing an average of approximately 4% per day in value.  Based on that, here's how I believe the stock will play out: 



Currently at the time of posting this (12/13/2021), $SDC is trading at $2.60.  Here's where I belive it will go in the next 30 days. 


12/14/2021: $2.49

12/15/2021: $2.39

12/16/2021: $2.29

12/17/2021: $2.20

12/20/2021: $2.12

12/21/2021: $2.03

12/22/2021: $1.95

12/23/2021: $1.88 

12/27/2021: $1.80

12/28/2021: $1.72

1/6/2022: $1.17 

1/7/2022: $1.12

1/8/2022: $1.07

1/9/2022: $1.03

1/10/2022: $0.97

1/11/2022: $0.93

1/12/2022: $0.89


I'm very confident that this prediction will age VERY well.  In fact, I think I'm actually being conservative with my predictions here, as $SDC could realistically fall below 50 cents by new years as bagholders continue selling.


This short is a very low-risk play, as $SDC is almost certain to continue dropping further and further.  Some say it's already dropped too much to be viable to short.  Well, people said the same about $WISH at $12.  Now, 6 mothe later, $WISH is heading towards $3.  If you haven't already, you may want to short $SDC now.  Not financial advice, I just personally belive this stock has nowhere to go but down.

9894,Chinese ADR Contingency Plan,rfrqrc,"If you’re like me, and you’re balls deep in Chinese ADRs, now might be the time to get yourself a broker that supports international exchanges and OTC markets, like Schwab, Interactive Brokers, or Fidelity. Then, you can transfer your ADRs via ACATS. 

(Some brokers charge for ACATS transfers. IBKR, for example, does not; so, you may want to start there when searching for a new home for your ADRs.)

If you don’t know if your broker supports international exchanges and OTC markets, now might be the time to call and ask. 

**Especially if you own DiDi Global ADRs. If your broker does not support international or OTC exchanges, and you own DIDI, you’re fucked. Unless you move now, before the delisting is complete.**

When it comes to the Chinese government, fears of blanket delisting are overblown. VIEs aren’t going anywhere. Regulators have pledged to respect where Chinese companies choose to list. 

Source: https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-12-01/chinese-regulator-denies-reports-on-vie-listing-ban-101812483.html

But the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) means that the threat of mass delisting by 2024 is still there, though far away, and in my view unlikely to cause any major issues. 

I honestly doubt that the CPC will outright prohibit oversight by the PCAOB, for the very simple reason that doing so would tank 235 companies, and cost an estimated $2.2 trillion overnight. This is also why they wanted to make it very clear to spooked foreign investors that they are not banning VIEs. 

Imagine multiple Evergrandes all at once, across multiple sectors, and you’d begin to get a sense of what that would look like. 

Not to mention that it would undermine what they said about respecting listing choices. 

And as Brian Gu of XPeng points out, there is still time for our governments to work something less draconian out.
 
Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/xpeng-sees-u-s-delisting-ultimatum-as-several-years-away

But if you’re like me, you don’t want to take any chances. You want to prepare for the worst, while still hoping for the best. 

If need be, I want to be able to directly convert my ADRs to Common Shares on the HKSE, SZSE, or SSE. Alternatively, if I don’t want to pay fees for converting the shares myself, I want to make sure I can liquidate my ADRs, then buy the foreign equivalents. Finally, I want to be able to buy and sell my stock, even if the security in question “goes dark.”

Some hedge funds have already begun switching to foreign markets for dual listed tickers like JD.com and Alibaba. Others, like Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, are sticking with ADRs for now, because of the higher liquidity offered by U.S. capital markets. 

Retail investors like us need to evaluate our options, too. 

With all of the tension between China and the U.S., I’d say it is highly likely that more Chinese companies will seek dual listings in the coming years. The CPC wants to gradually wean its economy off of its dependence on American capital, and that means pushing companies to seek listings closer to home. 

For their part, Chinese companies want to make sure that they have a way to raise capital outside of the increasingly hostile U.S. market. 

Companies like XPeng and Li Auto have already listed in Hong Kong, as a means of preparing for any eventuality with respect to the HFCA. As the HFCA deadline looms, I suspect that many more will follow, which is actually good news for savvy ADR investors.  

**Those of you who already own dual listed stocks: For now, your ADRs are going to have higher liquidity than the Chinese markets, so I would advise against converting them or buying foreign equivalents just yet. This is more of an escape hatch than anything.**

I just want to make sure that you guys are prepared for any conceivable outcome.

**TL;DR: If you own Chinese ADRs, especially DIDI, make sure that your broker supports international and OTC exchanges. If it doesn’t, open an account with one that does, and transfer your ADRs via ACATS.**",1639433764.0

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&ab\_channel=PeopleMakeGames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&ab_channel=PeopleMakeGames)

Insider Selling:

Craig Donato Chief Business Officer, Michael Guthrie Chief Financial Officer, Manuel Bronstein Chief Product Officer all dumping stock in the past 3 months. No insider buying.

Despite exploiting children they're still unprofitable and not forecasted to be profitable for 3 years. If they make changes to the platform to protect kids (which could impact revenue), it may take even longer to turn a profit. That's if the kids don't get bored of the game and move onto something else as they get older.

I also saw Jim Cramer recommend this stock for those who want exposure to the ""metaverse""

Roblox is bigger than; Nintendo's, Activision, EA, and Take Twos market cap.

This is the extent of my DD, and why I am bearish on RBLX. Immediately bought Jan 28/PUTS after coming across this information.

According to Wolfram Alpha, Roku doesn't get the majority of its profits from actually selling Roku devices, but from ADs on the platform. 

""Roku generates 14.3% of revenues from Player segment (Devices sold) while the rest comes from Platform Segment (Ads: 65% of profit)""

People are going to be getting these devices for Christmas, because of how low they are dropping their prices (You can get a 4k ROKU Device for $25 right now).

I'm expecting this stock to jump once the new year hits due to the influx of people opening Roku devices on Christmas.

10024,Puts on $LWLG: hedge fund managed share selling scam on a do-nothing company,rfn1yq,"Hello fuckers,

Today I want to introduce you to another shitco on which luckily you can buy shitputs.

Brief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.

For the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:

# $LWLG

The company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the ""development of photonic devices"" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.

Throughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:

\- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals

\- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance

I can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.

**So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**

Their revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:

>For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Moore’s Law.

So, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).

[Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)

Their main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest ""breakthrough"" or some award at random events they are attending.

**Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**

There must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they ""planned to sell components"" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.

[A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)

You can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.

Fun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).

>The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing  
>  
>Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...

This was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.

The stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.

**What's the thing with the hedge fund?**

There's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:

>Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies

Not so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is ""Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump"". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.

(side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)

Fortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:

[The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)

Their [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.

But who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:

>long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders

Well, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.

It's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.

Can it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.

[$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.

**Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**

The management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):

>As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.

For the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.

**Why should I buy puts now?**

There's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.

If the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.

If you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE: HUGE VOLUME IN DEC 17 17.5-20 PUTS**

Had the brilliant idea of checking out the options volume for basically all the puts in existence. Turns out on Dec. 8th somebody purchased in a single order [\~500x 17.5 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00017500#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) (premium: 1.1-1.3), and [\~900x 20.0 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00020000#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) (premium: 2.45).

Also interesting, the orders are typically executed around 2pm, both days.

We are talking about a total of \~350k$ in put options expiring in a week, which is not something one would throw in the wind for the fuck of it. This could be an indicator of an upcoming short report. Last time I've seen the exact same thing happening, it was with another shitco called Moxian (now below WSB threshold). Premium spent in puts was also in the 100ks order. Tried to check the usual suspects (Hindenburg, Muddy Waters and Scorpion Capital but haven't seen much hints.

And yeah, I wish that was me, but I doubt IBKR would be happy giving me 10x leverage on 1 week options.

**Can I somehow get fucked?**

Of course! And you likely will! Timing the market is notoriously impossible. All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.

Not financial advice and all the usual crap. Hasta la vista and see you in valhalla.

10085,Are we in a bubble or heading to a bubble? When will the bubble burst?,rfl3hq," Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to “poor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.”

And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then…

“Later in 2022-23E, we believe the ‘behind-the-curve’ Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&P 500 (Nasdaq \[approximately\] 25,000),” said the Stifel team.

“Populism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,” it said.

I already wrote down a DD part a few months back. Since then, another 20% got cut of the price, how ironic :-) For those, here it is [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2tpza/dd\_corsair\_again\_crsr\_bargain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2tpza/dd_corsair_again_crsr_bargain/)

Practically all information in that post still holds up today, only that we are approaching prices under 20 dollars now. Also, the forward PE sits at 13, lol. Short % of float is at 42% now. Price/sales is 1. 

Again, for the 'real' DD I would refer to that post, or to fellow posts. Here I am just trying to wrap my head around one thing. How the hell is this the 11th most shorted stock in the ENTIRE stock market? I simply cannot see why. Of course, there are bearish points when it comes to the stock. Looking at this with a rational mindset, these BY FAR do not outweigh all the positives, especially when you compare to other stocks in the market. Companies trading at negative pe ratios, P/S of 50, and a short % of float of 2%. If something is overvalued, or a big risk, it is these companies. Not a gaming company with solid revenues, p/s of 1, f-pe of 13, good cashflows and in general a insanely bright future ahead looking at the gaming/streaming space. 

The forever downtrend and short % remind me of GME (even though they were absurdly shorted). 

Can someone explain me why it can be rational looking at the NUMBERS not the technicals to short Corsair? Why is this a top 11 short play? Why is this valued so insanely bad with a f p/e of 13?",1639414310.0

FORD (F)

Disclosure: I have twenty Sept 16 2022 $22 Calls. The cost to open this position is an amount I can bare to lose and doesn't make me want to look at my portfolio every few minutes with dread. Invest an amount that you would be okay with it expiring worthless, never invest more than you're okay with losing!

\-Ford is one of the world’s most recognizable brands, right up there with Coca Cola and Apple in terms of ubiquity

\-On Wednesday December 08, 2021, Ford Chairman and founder’s great grandson exercised options to gain $20,000,000 in shares that he's holding onto...

“Rather than exercise the options and sell the shares immediately to realize the gains, he opted to exercise the options and buy the shares at the option price. In this case, he paid to acquire the shares and he also paid the associated taxes and fees rather than sell any shares to cover those costs” -Ford spokesperson

\-Ford had to stop taking orders at 200,000 units for it’s hyped F150 Lightning EV pickup truck which arrive at dealers mid-2022. These are “hard” or “real” orders according to the CEO. The F150 is the best selling vehicle in America and with gas prices at an all time and EV becoming more mainstream/acceptable is sure to be the first mainstream EV pickup. Tesla Cybertruck is set for delivery late 2022. Ford will already have the F150 EV on the road mid 2022.

\-The Ford Mustang Mach-E is in “incredible demand” these days, according to Jim Farley, the company’s CEO, who also confirmed that production will be increased to 200,000 units per year starting in 2022.

\- I used to work at a dealership (not Ford) and we knew Ford as the guys who can finance anyone. They have deep pockets and flexible underwriting in the finance department. Ford was the dealership that the buyers with less than stellar credit would go to after getting rejected at Toyota and Subaru and they would drive off with a new Ford

\*\*\*One more thing no one ever mentions, Ford CEO is first cousins with CHRIS FARLEY (r.i.p) and he even has an homage to his late cousin in his Twitter bio. Fuck if that isn’t reason alone to go all in on (F)

TLDR: Ford is turning into an EV company and ramping up sales of electric vehicles rapidly ready to compete at top levels on the EV front, dropping the shackles of its industrial past and embracing EV full steam ahead",1639412576.0

10173,Looking at the EV Market for what its worth - $LCID,rfiesg,"#  $LCID/Lucid Group Inc, 

once again Lucid Trading up - gathering back it's loses over the last 5 days... The EV market is becoming the next generation for those of us who like Automobiles... Finding the right companies that will last is key to the proper investments... I like Lucid for many reasons and before the end of the 4th Quarter This Stock will see its 52 week high again and again and will become comfortable trading above $65.... with less than 3 weeks remaining in the 4th quarter - some have questioned my controversial methodology of trading...... 

MotorTrend Car of The Year, Increased Productions going into 2022, over 500 Miles on a single charge.. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson doesn't ""want to be doing wealthy people's cars,"" he told ""Axios on HBO"" in an interview that aired Sunday.   Americans are warming up to the idea of electric cars, but the purchase price is still too high for many people, who also worry about how far their car will go before the battery needs recharging. 

The company is a Long-term Good investment and Buying Under $40 which is a a Resistant support level to $45, $47, $50... **in 6 Months I see $275 easily**  the market will be opening up to the everyday Jack - the $25K consumer purchase... They have delivered on everything they promised. The Air is an extremely well-built product. It gets the range. They said it has the performance they promise. All of that's great. Really of this cohort of EV start-ups, I'd probably ranked Lucid at the top for execution so far. Again, my question is, ultimately, what's it worth? How many of these Lucid Airs that they're going to sell? 

In the last 3 months, **3 ranked analysts** set 12-month price targets for **LCID**. The average price target among the analysts is **$44.33**. Analysts compare their price target to the current market price of the stock to determine how much potential upside or downside movement there could be in the stock price.

10183,"If a return of corona and lockdown is comming within weeks, what stocks would be a good trade (long and short)? DD below",rfi5c0,"The new omicon variant of the corona virus is spreading like wildfire in Norway right now. 10% of all corona cases have happened in the last week. That is 10% of the total cases recorded since the pandemic started in March 2020. 1 of 5 tests is positive. We have an all time high of people admitted to hospitals, and the number of people on respirators and death numbers are rising at an alarming rate. The government has already made some restrictions, but have called in a press conference today and warned of more restrictions.

If I am correctly informed Norway is ahead of the curve when it comes to the omicron variant of the coronavirus. With some early imports from South Africa. The assumption is that similar lockdowns will occur globally in some weeks. The question is what the market reactions will be? How much of these factors is already priced into the market? Which companies are already prepared for more lockdowns? Which companies are vulnerable, etc.? 

I was thinking maybe going long on Pfizer stocks as it is likely more vaccines are needed. 

Or short on airline companies since travel will be restricted, but then again a lot of airline companies have already prepared themself for corona operation.  

More data on corona in Norway:

10189,CLP/USD (Chilean pesos),rfhxt7,"Hi! On Dec-19th the second round of the presidential elections take place in Chile (South America). The two available candidates are a South American version of a Socialist and a South American version of a Conservative.

How unexpected to find these two alternatives on this part of the globe  /s

The local currency is called ""Chilean Peso"", ISO code ""CLP"".

If the results of the first round, when more candidates were available, are to be an indicator of the coming results, I believe there's room for the local currency to gain value.

Analyst pose the commie (bad for the CLP short term) ahead of the religious fruitcake (good for the CLP short term). Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/boric-vs-kast-chile-set-for-polarized-presidential-election-run-off.html) . Do what you want with this information.

I will be betting that:

(a) Analyst will be wrong. This based on a series of cases when pivotal decision making democratic processes had different that expected results since early 2010s, specially in the Americas. E.g. Trump in the US 2016; Brexit in the UK 2016; ""No"" in Colombia 2016; Bolsonaro in Brazil 2018 and Macri in Argentina 2015. Most of these elections faced traditional party candidates against outsiders, similar of what se are witnessing in Chile 2021.

(b) Socialist (South American version) voters tend to be lazier than their conservative (South American Version) counterparts making surveys less accurate.

(c) Media hype around the Socialist (South American version) will discourage his voters for some reason (I have no idea how the natives' minds work).

&#x200B;

Attached are the USD/CLP pair with the behavior it showed during the first round of the elections. Also, a list of candidates during round one and color coding with my personal opinion regarding where voters will flock.

Please keep in mind that futures are highly volatile. I have separate accounts in different brokers and jurisdictions; one to trade and the other to invest. This  compartmentalizes risk.

10237,And Just Like That,rffuta,"Is it possible that this stunt was coordinated? 

Did PTON management know that their product was going to kill a main character on the show? Or, was PTON really unaware?

I personally believe PTON was caught flat-footed and scrambled to put out the new And Just Like That ad with Mr Big and the instructor, created by Ryan Reynolds 

But, even if thats true, management has to go. If its not, and they watched the stock tank while sitting on the reply, hoo-boy. 

Its hard to imagine HBO using their product and footage of a Peloton class w/o clearance, the instructor is even credited in the show - but no product placement disclosure - did PTON not ask how it would be used?

If they didnt know, its time for new management. If they knew, its time for lawsuits (and new management)

EDIT: they didnt ask

>HBO procured the Peloton Bike on their own. Peloton was aware that a Bike would be used in the episode, and that Jess King would be portraying a fictional Peloton instructor,” Kelly said. “Due to confidentiality reasons, HBO did not disclose the larger context surrounding the scene to Peloton in advance.”

10242,$HIMX update and recent developments (up 14% in a week),rffm73,"Hey you fucktards,

Since I've posted my most recent discussion on Himax the stock has basically blown up. On tuesday the stock started to soar and continued its increase on wednesday to close on a high of $11,58.

On thursday it experienced a small decrease, but still had strong support at 11$. I think thursday is the perfect example of how this isn't just a pump and dump. The stock is still massively undervalued and the companies futur prospects just aren't priced in correctly. (Even Credit Suisse has a PT of **$23!**).

On friday the stock again increased by 5% and closed at $11,60.

This week has been the first time in long months that we have seen an important increase in volume and even tho this weeks price movement is insignificant if we look at the bigger picture, it brought an end to a 6 months long bearish run, proving that the current valuation is just as wrong as saying Powell hasn't slept with your wife's boyfriend.

In my opinion the stock still has enormous potential and it's only a question of time when we are going to meet the Credit Suisse PT and go beyond.

It's your boy Silbergleit Junior. About 10 days ago, [I wrote a post to warn you about UWMC short borrowing fees starting to rise](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r7j298/uwmc_short_borrowing_fee_is_up_9_times_in_the/) about 2 weeks after CEO Mat Ishbia announced accelerated buybacks as a retaliation move to shorts shorting his stock into the ground following the secondary offering announcement. The secondary offering was not supposed to be dilutive in nature. It was him and his father converting their Class B shares to Class A shares and selling them on the market to increase the float and attract more institutional investors. He and his father own 94% of the company.

# Short borrowing fee went up 5x last week

Anyway, 10 days ago, some of you goofs told me how 10% short borrowing fee is nothing and that I should ""call"" you later. That later has come. The short borrowing fee has quintupled last week. It went from 10% to 50% in only 5 days.

# Unusual Call Buying

That's not the only thing that happened last week. Silbergleit Trading Team has been closely monitoring unusual options activity and we were able to notice that 19,194 call options were purchased. This is an increase of 76% compared to the average volume of 10,881 call options. Here are some examples I spotted:

# What does 48.93% short borrowing fee mean?

Most of you goofs do not understand what 48.93% annual short borrowing fee means, so let me explain it to you in simple terms.

* You short 1,000 UWMC shares at $7.00
* You are net short $7,000
* To keep your short position open, you need to pay 48.93% annual fee. This comes down to $3,452.10. The fee is paid daily, therefore every day you need to pay $9.38.
* Now most of you will say, well what's the problem? I can pay $9.38 every day in interest. That doesn't surprise me since you are probably used to getting payday loans with deals such as $300 for $20 and most of you probably pay minimum required payment when you get your credit card bill. However, in the business world, paying 48.93% interest is insanity.

Some of you may argue, how short borrowing fee won't stay 48.93% for a long time and it will drop. I don't see it dropping until shorts start covering. Shareholders do not have intention to sell the stock that pays them a 5.8% annual dividend and with management doing buybacks.

# Mortgage companies don't squeeze.

Wrong. RKT's borrowing fee spiked to 49% on Feb 22, 2021. 10 days later we had a 130% jump on RKT on Mar 2, 2021.

10421,An argument in the defense of Robinhood as a broker,rf58z4,"**TL;DR:** Robinhood changed the investing game forever. Gone are the days of exorbitant fees and insane wait times. Despite its flaws, Robinhood remains one of the best brokers for traders whose strategies are solely through stocks and options. Especially for leverage and volatility strategies.

**Full post:**

There exists a commonplace antagonism against Robinhood in this subreddit. Perhaps much of that stems from their decision to restrict buying on several securities in January 2021. I present an argument in favor of Robinhood as follows:

1. Several brokerages also restricted buying on Jan. 2021. Perhaps a handful firms such as Fidelity did not impose any restrictions. However, Fidelity's AUM is $4.2 trillion USD, compared to Robinhood's $80 billion USD. Robinhood may also have had the moxie to fend off margin calls in Jan 2021 if it had Fidelity's resources
2. Robinhood changed the game for retail investing. Some innovations that Robinhood brought in are: eliminating high fees, instant access to deposits, clean and user-friendly interfaces.
3. Robinhood's margin fees are among the lowest at 2.5%. Perhaps M1 Plus and IBKR Pro are the only competitors with better rates
4. Robinhood's house margin requirements are among the lowest for many volatile securities. I have accounts with Fidelity and Vanguard. For many securities, the house margin requirements at Fidelity and Vanguard are 100% compared to Robinhood's 46%
5. Fidelity's execution quality claims to be better than RH ($18.97 vs $17.92) for stocks. This advantage is offset by aforementioned points. I will note that for options, I have not seen any price execution advantages at Fidelity or Vanguard, over Robinhood
6. Robinhood is one of the strongest proponents for instant settlement rather than the T+2 settlement that we currently have. Even with T+2 settlement, Robinhood found a workaround for instant settlements by creating margin accounts for everyone by default

**Conclusion:** RH forced other brokers to adapt, threatening their survival otherwise. I remember how greedy and clunky other brokerages were back in 2000s. Ridiculous fees and waiting times. I switched to Robinhood as my primary broker in 2019 and have no plans to jump ship as long as current status quo is maintained in terms of the brokerage stipulations and technologies. I currently have 99% of my net worth in RH.

I am not paid or influenced by anyone from Robinhood. I honestly like their product over other brokerages. I am making this post because I feel like my beloved brokerage gets an undeserved amount of hate on this sub.

&#x200B;

# TL

The fundamental premise is inflation is present. Within inflationary environments, there is a steepening of the long end of the yield curve.  The long end includes treasury bills with a maturity of 10 years or greater.

So, if the fed would increase interest rates like many are forecasting, then lending is reduced the economy slows, which adds deflationary pressures and problem solved. However, the FED can't really hike rates in our current fiscal situation. Unlike the 1970s when the US was a net creditor nation with hella stacks, we are now a net debtor nation with a 250% Debt to GDP ratio (rekkt). If federal funds rates increase it would cause the current interest on government debt (currently \~2%) to also increase. The resulting rise in interest could quickly bankrupt[ the US government](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/kelly-evans-can-the-fed-afford-to-raise-rates.html) (double rekkt).

**How So?**

Currently, at a 2% interest rate, the US Gov pays $400B in interest. If the FFR goes from 0.0 - 0.25% to 2.0-4.0%. We could see a corresponding doubling or tripling in interest rates. Meaning, we would have to spend close to $1 trillion in interest per year. But, those rates aren't even close to high enough to control inflation. Paul Volker had to increase the mf 'n FFR to 20%! Which would equate to $4T+ just in interest payments. 

So, since we can't raise rates, we are more similar to the 1940s US (shout out to Lyn Alden). Meaning, debt is high and inflation will run hot. Commodities and commodity producers will outperform this decade. These pressures cause the selling of long-term treasuries and a steepening on the long end of the yield curve. This is also known as a [bearish steepening](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-two-types-of-steepening-yield-curves). 

BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?!

HERE'S HOW WE MAKE MONEY

Our greatest advantage is that the US Bond Market is about to go from manipulated (via fed reserve purchasing) to the free market by [July '22](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/fed-s-powell-says-taper-could-start-in-november-finish-in-mid-2022-121092300065_1.html). The free market wants at least a breakeven rate on their T-bill which is currently[2.4%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE) on the 10Y. However, the 10Y is currently yielding 1.5%. 

Since $TLT moves inversely to yields, that would drop $TLT to \~$125. 

**What positions?**

The play itself has been laid out by the FED. Taper to begin Nov/Dec '21 and hopefully, end by mid '22.  

So, an end of '22/ beginning of '23 $TLT put would yield over a 100% return if treasury bonds return to their breakeven rates by June. 

I currently have 10 x 12/18/22 $135 puts

**Crayons**

I see a massive Head and Shoulders pattern with a bearish divergence in the right shoulder. The target for the H&S is \~$100. I'm being conservative with my personal target at $120 assuming rates return to breakeven levels.

**Risks**

1. Inflation is under control and CPI chills tf out.
2. People rush into the bond market to buy negative-yielding bonds.
3. I'm an idiot.

This is what Michael Burry was talking about when shorting 30Y treasuries and it finally clicked for me.

10498,Microvision (MVIS)- SIMON SAYS it's the PERFECT SHORT,rf13dv,"Hey guys, I'm going to detail why MVIS is an ideal short candidate, and HOW to ensure I'll NEVER get blown out short selling this stock.

At first glance MVIS appears to be bottoming (it's not). I've spent quite some time (and money) researching this company this year. I'm confident this POS has room to drop! This isn't going to be an epic instant payout like CHWY, DOCU, or ZM, although if you check the price action on some of their earnings call this year- they have a pattern of being pile-driven into the ground with good reason (20% AH last call when the CEO extended their timeline for selling their automotive lidar units). This is more of a consistent money maker until the macroeconomic climate shifts in which case it'll probably be a super printer... That being said I think the stock can drop from $6.43 to $3.00 by February EASY. 

First thing we'll look at is the borrow fee and shares available. As per iborrowdesk, laughably cheap and plentiful. As of close on Friday there is a 1.1% fee to borrow and 2,200,000 shares available.

So what? Aren't there plenty of stocks with that setup? Yes, of course- but MVIS is a highly speculative play which led to the demand for WSB's favorite: weekly options... UTT OH!!!

If you're unfamiliar with using call options to hedge against a short position you'll want to review this page:

 [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp)

Buying OTM calls gives you the right to own 100 shares of a stock at the price you choose. For a mere $5 dollars ($0.05 in options display) I can buy the weekly $18C. The only way this stock price will move against a short seller is a big news event. If the worst happens, I'm covered on every 100 lot of shares with some cheap insurance in OTM calls. But I doubt it... Microvision has pushed back their timelines for revenue on their last EC from having direct sales of lidar in Q4 originally to now 16 months from their last call (oct 28th) for their lidar to be evaluated. Revenue won't be hitting their books either for quite some time as the CEO is forecasting 2025 for vehicles with ADA's (advanced driver assistance AKA nanny tech for people who can't drive well themselves) to start shipping.

EC Transcript:

[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_1492ca296573e31026a18a9bd9058b30/microvision/db/1111/9879/file/Q3+2021+MVIS+Transcript+pdf.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1492ca296573e31026a18a9bd9058b30/microvision/db/1111/9879/file/Q3+2021+MVIS+Transcript+pdf.pdf)

The only reason to hedge this play with OTM call options is a surprise announcement regarding different IP that Microvision holds. Even if this works against you, if you do it right you can make money on the way up just as easily. Work the math between the borrow rate and the hedge's strike price and calculate the various scenarios yourself. MSFT's Hololens 2 (a NON consumer product) utilizes the light engine that MVIS developed. The speculative royalty amount is about $13 per unit, but some research should tell you that MVIS still has a $10M prepayment as a liability on their balance sheet regarding this. And their last earnings call did not show any substantial increase in revenue. 

[https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/345/microvision-announces-third-quarter-2021-results](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/345/microvision-announces-third-quarter-2021-results)

Either way, hololens 2 goes for $5,000 a unit and theres not much out there right now in terms of software. The Microvision CEO himself says the company is pursuing automotive lidar because the AR revolution is still a ways off. 

The same tech is most likely in the Army's IVAS (integrated visual augmentation system), but no worries, ANOTHER DELAY:

[https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2021/10/army-delays-22-billion-augmented-reality-goggle-program/](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2021/10/army-delays-22-billion-augmented-reality-goggle-program/)

It's gets better (or worse if you're long). The company this year has displayed some extremely poor financial management and maneuvering. On Feb. 16 they entered into a $50M at the market offering with Craig Hallum. They said that this should give them ""sufficient runway"" for the next year.

[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/16/2176640/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-50-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/16/2176640/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-50-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html)

Just a few short months later in June, they decided to do ANOTHER $150M ATM, further diluting shareholders. But instead of actually completing the offering and raising funds, on the following EC they told the investors that they only COLLECTED HALF of it! LOLOL so now an OPEN ATM to the tune of around $75M hangs over the head of investors. You can't make this stuff up! It totally disincentivizes new investors from hoping on board because the moment the stock goes up, they're grabbing more cash and diluting shareholders again. 

Let's think about this, they miscalculated once and had to raise funds by an amount of $150 million, they're liable to do so again.

And they're DEFINITELY going for that cash next chance they get because even though they're not making substantial revenue in the next few years, they have the balls to HIRE LIKE CRAZY. I predict someone will attempt to frame this as ""BAFF"" but it's an actual bath they're taking with this financial mismanagement. I think the last CFO Steve Holt knew how in the wrong the company was behaving so he couldn't take it and retired. That's my speculative guess, but this guy has tons of stock options and NEVER exercises them which bring me to my next case builder.

**SIMON SAYS THE STOCK GOES DOWN:**

Last Thursday evening Microvision investors were treated with a surprise email. Long time BOD member Simon Biddiscombe decided to dispose of 30,000 shares of MVIS at a price of $6.94 per share. 

[https://www.benzinga.com/secfilings/21/12/24538498/microvision-inc-biddiscombe-simon-director-sells-30-000-avg-price-6-89-form4](https://www.benzinga.com/secfilings/21/12/24538498/microvision-inc-biddiscombe-simon-director-sells-30-000-avg-price-6-89-form4)

MVIS bulls are wondering why would he sell ahead of the upcoming ""catalyst"" of the CES event in Las Vegas, my guess he knows its going to be a big dud like the ""IAA mobility event"" in Germany, in which all reputable tech media sources ignored Microvision forcing the CEO to do an interview with [InvestorPlace.com](https://InvestorPlace.com) (a site that historically bashes the company)

The company is posturing itself as a cash grab scam, they want to hire hire hire without showing investors how they plan to increase revenue ""We expect that by the end of the year we will have 100 to 110 people, a little lower than our prior guidance of 110 to 125."" Compare this to a true lean operation like INDI semiconductor and you'll start scratching your head...

This cart before the horse strategy is going to lead to them diluting the stock more, which will drive it down further... I wouldn't sweat a buyout situation at all now while shorting this, as I theorize a hostile takeover is the only possible way the company is acuired. What kind of company is going to pay many multiples of MVIS's current market cap and justify it to their shareholders? 

I sold my share position on Friday and will go short this week. I will most likely ease into the short position, as IV right now is elevated compared to historical values, meaning my hedges will be slightly more expensive than usual. To take advantage I'm thinking I'll run some call credit spreads and then after the FOMC meeting wraps up this week, I'll begin shorting and buying call options (which are most likely going to expire worthless). 

Automotive lidar is about as speculative as it gets, the company is pursing it in Germany because IMO the political push back on it in the US will be too great. No one knows how having a highway full of laser beams projecting everywhere will harm the environment, and heck even Elon is saying it's fool's errand. Then realize that MVIS's product is not even certified safe for use and this looks real tasty.

From the Q2 EC:

The   commonly   accepted understanding is that a laser product that has not been CE marked in the EU or has been or –has a product report submitted to the CDRH in theU.S., maybe operated by anyone else   other   than   the   manufacturer   in   certain   cases   and   approved   and   qualified manufacturing representative.""

Puts are tough because the IV is so high on this stock (so use I use put debit spreads if I go this route). Sometimes I'll watch the options chain because big players swoop in and attempt to gamma squeeze the put options. If I see a heavy put flow I'll go for it. The other situation where they work is playing to max pain. MVIS almost never surpasses max pain, in the summer iron condors weekly were the perfect play, but now-a-days it gets crushed too far down to risk that play.",1639351215.0

10524,"HashiCorp, Inc. (NASAQ: HCP) - New IPO",rezop2,"HashiCorp Inc. (the ""Company"") is one of the most recent IPO's. The company was well-received on the first day of trading. Below is my analysis of the company.  

Short-term: Sell

Long-term: Buy

Founded in 2012, the Company focuses on managing cloud infrastructure by adopting an innovative approach. The Company has built a portfolio of products based on the need for having consistent workflows to provision, secure, connect, and run infrastructure and applications across multiple public and private cloud environments. The Company's expected growth is based on the anticipated mass adoption of cloud services. The continued advances and innovations in this field will accelerate the adoption. 

The Company's products are open source. The founders believed that this would result in greater strength of the products and spark innovation. The Company then converts the (free) users to paid customers, as it appears that becoming a paid customer is inevitable for larger companies. The Company has 2,101 customers, expecting to grow its customer base as well as increase the revenue per client. 

Given the Company's strong position in the market, long-term growth is expected if the Company can execute on its strategies. However, we expect a decline in the price per share in the short term because of the impacts of a policy shift during the year preceding the IPO (see below). 

 Indicators in support of long-term growth:

\- Strong community of developers and the high-quality of the products

\- Overall expected growth of the cloud market

\- Above-average management; CEO has been with the Company since 2015; one of the co-founders acts as CTO

\- Repeat sale is expected given the nature of the business (Switching the provider is difficult for customers). 

\- Straight-forward and proper accounting policies (e.g., capitalization policy only applies to internally-used software, and all R&D relating to products is expensed).

In the short term, we see some hurdles to justify the current price per share because the current valuation prices in a future growth that is equal to historical growth. We believe this will not be achievable in the short term due to the following reasons: 

\- In preparation for IPO and in an effort to reduce the expenses, the Company implemented cost-cutting policies: both R&D and Sales expenses are lower as a % of revenue for the six months ending Jul 2021 compared with Jul 2020. Combine this with the multiple reviews from public sources that employees have complained that salaries at HashiCorp are lower than other comparable tech companies. Therefore, the shortage of talent (at least temporarily) might hinder Company's efforts to grow the business. It appears that the management is not oblivious to this fact; therefore, we expect course correction, but it will take time. 

\- It appears one of the co-founders is not with the Company anymore. Again, this does not have a permanent long-term adverse impact if managed appropriately, but there might be some short-term implications. 

Other items to note:

The IPO is for Class A Common shares which have 1 voting right per share. The original owners of the Company own Class B Common shares which have 10 voting rights per share. Therefore, limited decision-making power by the outsiders.",1639347129.0

 TL;DR. Elon has 6,977,718 shares left to sell (per his original 10% promise).  Based on how much he owes in taxes by exercising options and selling, the minimum # of shares he must sell are \~ 4,900,000 (using an average sale price of 1074).  Expect sales every other day to every third day.  Impact on price action on the days he has sold has generally been negative, as expected).  Details/analysis are in the link.

10597,Copper stonk(very undervalued),revrhc,"Ticker Symbol:FCX(FREEPORT MCMORAN).
The electric vehicle industry is booming, this is no secret. According to the white house, half of all new vehicles would be electric by 2030. Copper plays a key role in the batteries of electric vehicles.The usage of copper in electric vehicles is way higher than a traditonal one. For instance, traditional cars use about 18-49 pounds whereas plug-in-hybrid EVs use approximately 85 pounds, battery electric vehicles contain 183 pounds, a hybrid bus contains 196 pounds and finally, a battery electric bus contains 814 pounds.(""Copper Drives Electric Vehicles"", from www.copper.org) These would cause massive demand for copper for decades, helping share prices to go up.

Freeport is one of the largest copper miners on the world( Top5) . 14.6 PE,2.7 PS ratio,0.39 debt to equity ratio.Net income, margins, revenues and cash flow,EBITDA are going up significantly. The Zacks investment research firm expects EPS to grow 29.2% YoY for 3-5 years. Thus, a PEG of around 0.5, making shares very undervalued.

Richard Adkerson(CEO)said,""The world is getting increasingly electrified and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently doing now.""(Q3 earnings call)

I won't bore you fellas anymore, last thing I wanna add is that copper is in low supply yet the demand is high. This is similar to the chip shortage in ways that will boost these copper miners due to strong tailwinds. I suggest looking at their latest report that I linked down below.

10640,November gainers - top tickers with the highest insiders *buying* activity,reu74w,"Hola! Today's research will be based on insiders' buying activity.

I've collected the data from financial sources like Nasdaq and then aggregated it for all public US companies (5400 companies). As a result, I discovered top companies where the insiders have been buying shares the most rapidly over November:

**1.** **Canoo Inc. (**[**$GOEV**](https://contora.ai/ticker/GOEV)**) -** a mobility technology company, designs, engineers, develops and manufactures electric vehicles for commercial and consumer markets in the United States.

[$GOEV](https://preview.redd.it/yggnoegyf5581.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b1e637e06d4fa35bdb174a14c1cca6e2fbd3794)

Canoo's stock gained an astounding 49% in November after exceeding the Q3 report expectations on November 15th:

Also, on November 16th, $GOEV announced that they plan to start production of its first EV model (a battery-electric passenger van called the Lifestyle Vehicle) before Q4 2022 which caused lots of discussions on Twitter that day and affected the stock's price as well:

[$GOEV twitter mentions](https://preview.redd.it/pwb9ptt1g5581.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=64829b91531e875495499d8ab68179cdbf615a94)

**2.** **Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (**[**$OTLK**](https://contora.ai/ticker/OTLK)**) -** a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on developing and commercializing monoclonal antibodies for various ophthalmic indications.

[$OLTK](https://preview.redd.it/6vdl5jw3g5581.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=c12a3ffeca6710d611757d2dd6c07288ff8223eb)

**3.** **Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (**[**$SIRI**](https://contora.ai/ticker/siri)**) -** headquartered in New York, Sirius XM Holdings Inc. was founded in 1990. The radio broadcasting company creates and broadcasts a variety of content such as commercial-free music, premier sports and live events, news and comedy and exclusive talk and entertainment shows. Sirius XM provides radio services to users in the United States and Canada.

$SIRI stock is one of the top value stocks to invest in for the long term according to the hedge-funds and analysts. Also, Sirius has been actively hiring new staff this year which can't be a bad sign for investments:

4. **Axon Enterprise, Inc. (**[**$AXON**](https://contora.ai/ticker/axon)**) -** the company develops, manufactures, and sells conducted energy weapons (CEWs) under the TASER brand in the United States and internationally.

[$AXON](https://preview.redd.it/vc63hql9g5581.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8fa2030fe763008bd0fb9be3cce9dbebe5ebea)

Axon Enterprises continues to push the limits of its software solutions, expanding into several key areas over the last 10 years. Btw, $AXON has surpassed Q3 earnings and revenues estimates:

10651,Cathie Wood is a crazy person and I love it and her (and portfolio Volatility),retuvp,"Now your probably wondering, Why would I want a crazy person to be my fund manager? I'll tell you why

A Crazy ETF manager is a good thing, I don't trust non-crazy people especially as my ETF manger, They need to be hounds that do the unconventional and in completely irrational ways, Wouldn't want some straight edge bozo managing my money they'd get below average returns and yes that could be lower volatility but I am so risk seeking I'd pull a parachute in the last ten seconds of a skydive just like in point break just to play a little chicken, RISK AVERSION is a scam. whats the point of investing if I do not have portfolio gains and loses of about 2-5% daily I don't care if I lose 5000$ a day for a week straight I'm here for the long term and if my plays pay off i'll be up so much i'll laugh at the Volatility, I EAT VOLATILITY, I MARGIN DOWN and increase my position.  This isn't for everyone but this is the only way for me, I understand my companies into the nitty gritty if they drop I laugh at seller and buy more.

&#x200B;

WE PRINT.

Tl;DR ETF mangers need to be crazy, I am a Volatility god and I believe risk-aversion is one hell of a money losing drug.

10653,An Objective Look at Jim Cramer,retpwo,">*Cramer gets a lot of shit around here, and most of it is deserved.  I wanted to take an objective look at why people like or dislike this guy. This is what I came up with. Would love to discuss more in the comments*

Jim Cramer is an investor turned stock-evangelist who has probably reached a wider audience with his financial advice than anyone in human history. Unless you consider the biblical forbearance on lending to be financial advice, in which case the list goes: Jesus, Cramer. Or maybe Mohammed, Jesus, Cramer. Regardless, it’s rarified air.

**What’s Cramer’s story?**

Harvard, Harvard Law, Goldman Sachs, launched his own hedge fund, founded a publicly traded media site *The Street*, wrote six books on investing, and of course, hosted 17 seasons of “Mad Money.” On paper, Cramer’s the wet dream of compensating parents everywhere. *I raised a winner, a winner!* 

**What’s to like about Cramer**

He’s fun. He’s like the cool teacher from high school but for stocks. You learn about business, but you also learn about life, and he just gets it the way your parents never could. Sure, his histrionics get annoying, and are possibly a cry for help, but he’s knowledgeable, contagiously passionate, and his show is an entertaining way to keep in touch with the financial markets.

**What’s Not to Like** 

A lot of what Cramer does is a disservice to his viewers. He promotes excessive risk-taking under the guise of public education. Cramer purports to be all about empowering Middle America by preaching advanced stock-picking techniques, but he knows the vast majority of his viewers have no chance to beat the market, and those that stand a chance don’t need him anyway. Cramer is to stocks what Dog is to Bounty Hunting. He turns a profession into entertainment. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, there’s just nothing particularly useful about it. Cramer knows this, he even tells his viewers this occasionally, but that message is drowned in a tsunami of ticker-tape and sensationalized minutiae that turns irrelevant ten seconds after Cramer feigns a stroke at hearing it. 

Some people don’t like Cramer's personality. Cramer is one of the old guard, a veteran of the investing era before personal computers, when the most confident personalities made the most money. Haters find Cramer jockish, overconfident, condescending, inauthentic, greedy, and creepy. All of those accusations have merit. He's pissed off entire groups of investors (like wsb) because he's an unapologetic hot-take machine. That's his job. He's the Skip Bayless of finance. The difference, though, between Cramer and an ESPN analyst is that people are investing their life savings in the market. Worse, Cramer will occasionally get serious and give high-quality financial advice. He's capable of doing that, but he's also capable of spitting off five terrible stock recommendations. Viewers have to know when he's doing a shtick and when he's being authentic and that can be hard. Should CNBC be held to a higher standard than ESPN? 

This leads to the inherent conflicts of interest. People listen to him - they buy stocks when he says to, which means he has the power to move markets. Do Cramer or any of his cronies exploit this power to manipulate markets and illegally make money? That's difficult to prove but at the very least he doesn't do a good job of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. 

Lastly, Cramer has a habit of making absurd, disturbing headlines, including but not limited to:

* Repeatedly calling Lenny Dykstra (who Bleacher Report named one of professional baseball’s 25 biggest Sleazeballs) “the greatest mind on Wall Street.” Dykstra was awarded his own column on Cramer’s TheStreet.com, which was revoked after Dykstra was busted by the SEC for fraud.
* Martin Shkreli, famed “pharma-bro,” was arrested on securities fraud, revealed in an interview that Cramer gave him his first job. Shkreli recalled: “Jim interviewed me and he asked what I did, I said I played guitar. And he asked me to come and play guitar to prove it. And I played all these wedding songs and I started work at Cramer’s hedge fund March1, 2000, when I was 16.”
* Cramer apparently admitted to securities fraud, although he later clarified he was speaking hypothetically about the behavior of others. Jon Stewart interrogated him on the matter and it’s must-see TV. 

In Cramer’s defense, he has a target on his back (that he put there) and sometimes gets unfair criticism. During the midst of the financial crisis, he encouraged viewers not to withdraw their Bear Sterns savings accounts. Bear Sterns went bankrupt and the press excoriated him, but his advice was spot-on: the savings accounts were FDIC insured.

&#x200B;

>*TLDR: Cramer is a legitimately good investor with a lot of impressive credentials and a good investing track record. But little of that transfers to the character he plays on TV. He repeatedly puts himself in bad situations, he has  conflicts of interest (or at least appears to and he does little to avoid the appearance), and he can be annoying.

10671,Vacasa - Home rental management company that could have a lot of short term upside,rese22,"Vacasa ($VCSA) just went public this last Tuesday, and if any of you have followed it, the shares have closed down over 20% from the opening price on Tuesday (more than 15% from the SPAC share price of $10). However, I think this presents an interesting opportunity for investors, seeing two thing are true with Vacasa's publicly traded stock float.

1. The public float is relatively small. Per the registration documents and prospectus filed, the number of shares that are currently publicly tradable constitute less than 10% of the total share outstanding, making the public float more volatile and prone to bigger swings (this could be perfect for a run, considering the initial sell off).
2. This brings us to the second point, which is the lock up restrictions in place. As seen below from the prospectus, PIPE shareholders, insiders, and other forward purchasing agreement shareholders are restricted from selling shares for 180 days after the closing of the merger (December 7).

https://preview.redd.it/3y5w6uy315581.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec1bbf2b9ed22ef8906ac7513a5d795157ed15bf

[Insiders and other Lock-up Holders can sell some shares if the last closing price of the stock is above $12.50\/share or $15\/share respectively](https://preview.redd.it/uai1ncx415581.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4fb221082c4fb01c805659db4a0a74f56d0b23)

TLDR; the stock *could* run because of the low float and lockup restrictions in place. The selling that took place last week may have been a technical event or related to macro issue. Or it could have been a bunch of day traders taking advantage of the low volume to short last week. At $8.24/share, the stock is attractive with one analyst pegging the stock target at $15/share.

Carnival and Norwegian have both been consistently over the $45-50 mark for the past five years, prior to Covid. In March of 2020 both stocks shit the bed, as did the entire market. CCL bottomed out at $8.49 in April of 2020 before bouncing back to $21.49 in June of 2020. NCLH bottomed out at $8.72 before bouncing back to $22.42 in June of 2020. This past June saw CCL at $30.54 and NCLH at $32.33 before they both dropped down to at or below the $20 mark this month. I believe that both of these stocks will break the $30 mark by next June. I put about $20k into calls this week, ending with positions of 35 CCL $20 calls for June 17, 2022 and 36 NCLH $22.5 calls for June 17, 2022. If I am right and both of these hit even $25 before June I stand to make a good chunk, if I am wrong and they suck I will just continue with Plan A: working until I die.

Edit: I did not anticipate this big of a dip this morning but took advantage and bought another 50 contracts of CCL at $2.02 to average down. Now have 85 CCL and 36 NCLH

Update: haven’t sold yet but I’m currently up about 16k. May start selling some off tomorrow

10797,FedEx heading into the shits? Discussion with some DD,rekvn0,"**TL;DR**

I think FedEx’s earnings are going to tank because of their inability to control costs related to the labor shortages compared to their competition and that you can make tendies on puts or shorts, but this probably won’t be the next DOCU play

**Preface:**

All over the world logistics companies are facing labor shortages and increased shipping loads, on top of the ports being backed up especially a bad thing for courier companies for this quarter since Christmas shopping is in full swing and shopping for tendies online is at an all-time high thanks to covid.

**FedEx’s shipping rate hikes but why I think they mean nothing:**

Last earnings, FedEx announced an increase in rates but it would only take effect on Jan. 3, 2022, these will apply to all US domestic, US export and US import services. FedEx Ground, which delivers to businesses, and FedEx home delivery will increase by an average of 5.9%. FedEx Freight customers could see an increase of up to 7.9%.

Earlier this month starting Nov.1, FedEx also announced that a fuel surcharge will be added to certain FedEx shipments, including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments. Effective Nov. 15, 2021, Item 525 Over Length and Item 530 Extreme Length surcharges will also increase.

This rise in rates are always expected due to the build-up of the end of year shipping rush, but I think these rate hikes have come too late as it will only partially offset their fuel costs.

**Labour shortages and increased hiring cost problems:**

Taking data from this news report from Convey a few weeks back:

[https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/)

We can see that FedEx has all along been pretty fucked in terms of their labor problems as this has making them consistently fail in their on-time deliveries. I will explain more on why I think this is relevant below.

Besides the chaos, we still have headlines of FedEx employees dumping packages probably thanks to the insane pile up of packages at this time of the year.

**Flip-side argument from Shipmatrix but why its bullshit**

&#x200B;

[Boomer ShipMatrix reports Fedex being on time](https://preview.redd.it/x1xv2viel2581.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d04a810f359c95c0901d5e5b462a4a83c016837)

Boomer shipmatrix.com disagrees with Convey’s reporting matrix and is instead reporting much better on-time deliveries because they use the total time in transit rather than accounting for when each individual courier receives, processes and then delivers each package.

I wont be going into the specifics here but I personally think ShipMatrix is more retarded than the average WSB autist here.

I don’t know anyone who can even agree with these bullshit numbers that they are pulling out of their ass.

A quick sub-reddit research seems that there’s more chaos over in /r/Fedexers/ vs that of UPS /r/UPSers

[FedEx - December 2021](https://preview.redd.it/yph45uv2l2581.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5259fd887d490072dfc860cfdeae9fcaceb36d4c)

**Why do any of these numbers matter?**

Not being able to deliver on time had already led to them losing contracts with time sensitive meal-kit businesses, as noted during its last earnings it lost customers such as Clean Eatz Kitchen Inc. due to delays that cost the company thousands of dollars’ worth of shipments of ready-to-eat frozen meals that ended up spoiled in transit.

Next up on some meal-kit business that will lose or have already lost their contract with Fedex:

1. Home Chef - Users grumbling on facebook & reddit
2. Sun Basket – users are reporting that they have already switched away from Fedex to Courier Express (not a listed company so who cares)

A quick look into any of the meal kit subreddits or a quick google has angry customers complaining about long delays of even up to a week in receiving their meal kits. Can you imagine what happens if you let fresh foodstuff sit in a warehouse with no temperature controls for 3 days, what happens after 5? What happens if that week’s kit has seafood?

Take a look here and you can see nothing but disdain for FedEx in relation to meal kit deliveries.

How many of you personally ordered tendies but they came in late because of FedEx?

**Non food related delivery problems also extend into delays of delivery of sensitive documents**

[https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/hundreds-hit-passport-delays-even-25551792](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/hundreds-hit-passport-delays-even-25551792)

Over at the UK side, FedEx is also fucking up on passport deliveries.

**Possibly higher Labor costs vs their peers:**

I remember reading FedEx is also paying more for labor acquisitions than their peers at DHL/UPS/USPS etc but I haven't gone and dug up more about it beyond this news report.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx)

**Summary**

FedEx is reporting that they expect higher shipment volume but the increase in revenues wont be high enough to cover their rising costs since they can't even handle the current volume with the current labor shortage. They have also been lagging behind their peers in managing costs possibly leading into an earning's miss and tanking the share price further.

I will likely be picking up puts come market open after I get more allowance from cashing in my good boy points with Mommy.

\*edit\*

Fedex's share price when put against its peers UPS, DHL and Maersk also seems correlated to its poor ability to deliver.

**The Play**

Puts or shorts for potential earnings miss.

\*edit\*

IV pretty low currently so we won't be fucked on option plays

**Risk**

– Share price has already tumbled from its ATH levels of $314 earlier this year. (Currently $246)

– FedEx has other businesses under their arm and this discussion only covers the failings of FedEx Ground

– This may have already been priced into the analyst expected earnings estimates.

The semiconductor industry has grown into a $4.67 trillion aggregate containing an extensive group of companies at the crux of modern technology. Semiconductors are at the foundation of modern life, as they are materials with conductive properties used to manufacture various kinds of electronic devices across all industries. They are the foundation of modern life, as they enable everything from cars to medical devices to appliances. 

	Over the past 30 years, the industry has experienced rapid growth in response to the various technological advancements during this time period. Techn0logical evolutions of PCs in the 1990s, internet services during the 2000s, and smartphones during the 2010s would not have been possible without advanced chip performance from semiconductors. An estimated $3 trillion in global GDP between 1995 to 2015 has been directly attributed to semiconductor innovation… (continued in article)

My question is are these analysts underestimating Rivian's chance of posting an actual profit according to these estimates for production Rivian should have already gone bankrupt but they havnt so im gonna completely reverse any knowledge of how earnings work and just gamble my money in Rivian options my question is what optionsmand since my account is too much of a liability to tastyworks i cant use spreads.

* **Total expected production: over 1,200**R1T: approximately 1,200R1S: approximately 25electric delivery vehicles : approximately 10
* **Total expected deliveries: over 1,000**R1T: approximately 1,000R1S: approximately 1electric delivery vehicles: approximately 10

revenue from deliveries not profit

R1T:67,500 usd x 1000 = 67,500,000 usd

R1S:70,000 usd x15 = 1,050,000

electric delivery vehicles r a part of a contract with Amazon so they wont be counted

i used this probably untrustworthy website for production numbers

10972,"U.S. Federal Fleet Report, and XL Fleet's next moves?",reastx,"Following review of FY2020 Federal Fleet Report, it seems the next departments or agencies XL Fleet would best be approaching are the DoA, DHS, DoJ, and USPS, looking at Table 5-1. XL Fleet already has a program with DoD, which addresses 30 million gallons gasoline consumption, second to USPS at 200 million gallons gasoline and diesel combined.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/is87pot2sz481.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c7a8e88eafb0fba79aa95f88e98773f238545d

&#x200B;

Looking at Table 2-1, DoA and DHS are more likely to be a customer than DoJ, due to the higher quantity of trucks vs. passenger vehicles utilized.  DoA has the third highest inventory of light duty vehicles, which is worth noting as the recent Executive Order 2021-27114 Sec. 204 that "" Each agency's light-duty vehicle acquisitions shall be zero-emission vehicles by the end of fiscal year 2027."" XL Fleet intends to initiate production of all-electric models next year, so it is possible XL Fleet may contract with these departments.

USPS is not a direct opportunity, unless OSHKOSH contracts with XL Fleet for the NGDV, as previously posted. Given XL Fleet is working on idle technology, the possibility should not be dismissed.

However, as the average age of the federal fleet vehicles is 14.8 years as shown in Table 2-9, these opportunities for XL Fleet can go either way. By the time replacements are needing to be procured, manufacturers may have hybrid/elec. options by then (5 years?). Maybe it's not likely any of these departments or agencies would retrofit a 15 year old vehicle with hybrid/elec. technology, and rather procure new equipment. Or, as these become replaced, XL Fleet's equipment will be implemented anyways by that time as the relationship has been established.",1639262781.0

11120,FORDS MANAGEMENT HAS GOT THE GOODS: & A GOOD WAY TO PREDICT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.,re41t4,One of the causes that should be used in all probability calculations is managements will to discontinue a losing segment. In the calculation for the weight of this cause I suggest you express it as a quantifying percentage that is linked proportionally to the percentage of the companies revenue that the profit losing segment provided. Companies that have the will to cut dead wood perform substantially better than those who do not. Ford cut sedans out of the line up. Those cuts needed to be done to improve profitability. Practically a substantial part of the reason for the performance improvement is the message the action sends to the staff and workers. The message is clear: if products you are working on are not profitable cuts will be made. So it’s best to point out and fix any inefficiencies and put your best effort in to work efficiently and effectively. In addition you should make yourself aware of how your performance and the performance of the products you are working on measure up in the market so you are not surprised if cuts are made.,1639242507.0

11139,Diabolical Tax Reduction Scheme,re337t,"I'm sure most of us here are familiar with the Wash Sale Rule. Where if you sell a security at a loss, then buy an identical security less than 90 days later, any loss will not be counted on taxes.

The IRS does this because historically people have sold all their red positions after Christmas only to buy them back in order to realize a loss. Realizing losses early reduces your income for that year, reducing tax burden. It's essentially the mirror image of why people hold for decades, in order to put off paying taxes on your tendies. Money now is always better than money later.

Inevitably you must realize your total profit/losses, unless you die and pass on your stocks to someone else and their buy-in price for tax purposes becomes the current market price.

However, there are a few specific ways to get around the Wash Sale Rule that all center around how the securities must be EXACTLY IDENTICAL. If you own a LEAP option in the red, you should sell that and buy a new one with a different strike or expiry. The tax reduction will totally be worth the commission paid and you can use the opportunity to adjust your risk.

Also note leveraged and unleveraged ETFs are not identical securities even if they track the exact same index.

This year I have been running the wheel on DFEN, and at the moment I'm holding shares in the red. I decided to switch to a PMCC on ITA. These track the same sector and are both largely have the same major positions.

11143,"$3T CBO Build Back Better, Dec 15 Federal Reserve, Put/Call ratio going up???",re2uwj,"Interestingly, on the same day inflation (6.8%) was released ([my prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation_countdown_10_minutes_830_et_my_guess) was 6.7 to 6.9% :)), the news on the [CBO's estimate](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/12/10/cbo.report.on.build.back.better.pdf) of the Build Back Better plan showed if stuff was made permanent and not temporary, the debt will increase by $3T.

https://preview.redd.it/sxzt2e18ox481.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c251249c50f5a7cfa4539b03b7fd3f1e10ea21e

You can see the child tax credit if made permanent after 2022 for 10 years will cost $1.4T extra alone. And child care will cost $700B after 2027 for 3 years. Both add $2.1T or so to the debt if any proposal is made permanent.

Joe Manchin [seems to be ""shocked""](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/10/politics/build-back-better-cbo-score/index.html) according to Lindsey Graham.....

However, this seems rather unfortunate. **Not sure what you guys think, but can the US Senate edit the bill to specifically make proposals bindingly expire and make it impossible to make it permanent? This can alleviate some of Joe Manchin's concerns so then BBB can pass.**

Another proposal is removing specific proposals ie the Child Tax Credit and Child Care to ""save"" $2.1T, and make Joe Manchin vote for the bill.

**What do you guys think on whether BBB will be passed before Christmas?**

On other news, the FOMC Fed meeting will be December 15 Wednesday. Since inflation was within expectations, presumably people expect the Fed to taper x2 speed. It's possible people might still panic on December 14 and cause the Dow / SP500 to maybe go horizontal or even drop tinnily for risk aversion. What do you guys think?

On Friday Dec 17, Quadruple Witching forces options to expire - either people exercise their put/call options or leave them to expire. Also the put/call ratios from CBOE are fascinating.

https://preview.redd.it/hilbd113sx481.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=54f194476811b46e9607e07d3375b635afc0fe38

On Dec 7, Put/Call for VIX was 1.45 ie 145 puts v 100 calls. That makes sense since Omicron was reasonable. Then 8 Dec (Wed) put/call was 0.73 for VIX, meaning 73 puts v 100 calls. That's also interesting, since inflation was Dec 10. Likewise now VIX will reduce on Dec 10 since 119 puts v 100 calls.

However what I'm confused is why is the ETF / Index Pull/Call INCREASING??? What is going on??? I'm not sure if the CBOE is 1 day delayed, but why is puts INCREASTING?

11226,"Goldman Sachs Says Risk of Major Stocks Drawdown Modest for Now, per Bloomberg",rdy4oi,"(Bloomberg) --

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)  strategists said there’s little reason to expect a major retreat in  U.S. stocks in the months ahead, even as the breadth of the rally that  has pushed the S&P 500 index into successive records is getting  increasingly narrow. 

**Just five stocks account for 51% of the U.S.  benchmark’s returns since April,** Goldman’s strategists led by David  Kostin wrote in a note to clients. Those same stocks - [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), [NVIDIA Corp](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US)., and [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)  \- together account for more than a third of the gauge’s returns this  year and more than a fifth of its total market capitalization, according  to the strategists. 

**The S&P 500 rose to another** [**all-time-high on Friday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R3X4IXT0AFB4)**,**  after a swift rebound from a post-Thanksgiving slump triggered by the  spread of the omicron variant. The highest year-over-year U.S. inflation  reading since 1982, and an increasingly hawkish tone from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13598Z:US), have not [deterred investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/dip-buyers-scoring-historic-win-in-stocks-that-defy-bond-warning) from buying the dips. 

The difference between the initial post-pandemic  rebound and the recent gains is that the breadth of the rally has  markedly narrowed, and this has been causing alarm, according to  Goldman. “Following periods of sharply narrowing market breadth –  similar to the recent experience – equities have historically exhibited  weaker-than-average returns and deeper drawdowns,” the strategists  wrote. 

Looking ahead though, there are few  reasons to see why history would repeat itself this time.  **“The macro  environment does not suggest drawdown risk is elevated in the coming  months,” the strategists wrote,** highlighting that earnings and margins  continue to surpass expectations, a low risk of recession, and share  prices already reflecting the likely Fed tightening. 

“Nominal and real rates are expected to rise but  remain low over the coming months, supporting the backdrop for both  valuation and equity demand,” the strategists said, **advising investors  to own stocks with high growth and high margins.**

11234,HB7+/Walmart ratios 5 points off 2008 all-time highs,rdxoey,"While purchasing groceries at Walmart today, I calculated the hb7+ ratio of employees, which is the percentage of girls working at Walmart that are at least 6.5s (have to round up)

15 of the 37 employees were hb7+, breaking 40 percent for the first time since Q1 2011, and only 4.2 points off of all time highs of q4 2008. Accounting for obesity inflation, these numbers are even more concerning, and using adjusted 2008 levels of obesity, my calculations show a 49% hb7+ level in Real Rating. These are all time highs since 2004.

For comparison, we saw a cycle low of only 19.4 hb7+ percent during a particularly long heatwave in September 2019, shortly after school started, this number fluctuated between 19.4 and 24.6, only cracking 25 q2 2020. For the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, we saw surprising stability, hovering within 1 point of 29. A large run up after the ending of extended unemployment benefits caused a break through 30, and we hovered 32+-1.5 until 2 weeks before Halloween this year. I have no idea what has caused it, but I have seen alarming gains of at least .7 each week since then, culminating in a 2.1 (2.1!) percentage gain this week. 

I couldn't let this go without mentioning. We are in for tough times, my friends. Lots of people will tell you to worry about the price of bread, or gas, or rent, or the value of SPY, or even interest rates. I am here to tell you the there is no better economic health indicator than circumstances (doesn't matter what) that would drive an hb7 to put an application in at Walmart, actually show up to training, and literally go to work to collect a paycheck. I hope this information helps at least one of you.

11315,"Wrote a Monte Carlo Simulator for strategy testing, based on winrate.io. (Source code only)",rdskxk," 

You should have a strategy to test with it and have done all of the backtesting before using the program. It won't create a strategy, just test the limits of a strategy and give you information on the most likely outcomes after X number of trades. Ideally any strategy should be backtested at least a few hundred times. If you give the program inaccurate/untested data it will spit out even more inaccurate data. The program is like a supped up version of [winrate.io](https://winrate.io/). That's actually where I got the idea for it. It has the ability to run any number of simulations at once(SuperSim) and aggregate the data for greater accuracy. C# code only. No binaries. No license. Use as you see fit. If you improve the program please send a copy of the source code my way by DM.

Thanks

11461,"Experimented with SPY call debit spreads, curious about tax implications",rdmwvl,"Hello. Maybe this isn't really discussion but I'm having trouble getting in touch with a CPA at the moment and I'm torn for support, and I'm having trouble posting with the Loss flair. Also asked on [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) but I felt it might also help getting some input here.

First off I'll state I'm pretty new to options trading and may have been a bit eager (read: an enormous moron who should've not even bothered). I saved and set aside $6,000 on RH to practice, and found that 100 contract SPY debit spreads with far off expiry and deep otm strikes gave me the best results, as I thought I could sit on them without worrying too much about theta over time. I started this strategy at about the beginning of October and it worked well and I made marginal gains on opening and closing SPY spreads until Omicron hit, and I had sold and lost some profit out of fear. Around this same time, I finally read up on wash sales.

Because these were 100c spreads, each leg involved is buying or selling 100 calls. Since SPY has been hovering in the late 400s, each leg then is worth usually around 40k. I see this reflected in my statements, where the legs themselves are shown as the transactions, with my total credit and debit across the past two months approximately on 1m debit and 1m credit. As I understand it, the wash sale applies to these legs individually. I closed my last SPY position on the 8th of this month, so I'm assuming the wash sale will spill over into next year.

I guess my question is I can't figure out if I'm going to be taxed just on my actual gains (which would be $3,000 since that's how much I had made with the debit spreads), or if I'll be taxed purely on the gains of the individual legs, which if I can't deduct the losses, I fear means paying taxes on a million dollars in gains even though my actual gains were in the hundreds?

Honestly I get I'm an idiot for letting this situation prop up, and will accept whatever vitriol it might bring. If I need to provide any more info I can, I just want to know how bad I messed up.  
Provided crops of my statements so I could post. If the worse case scenario is real then I at least hope it counts for loss porn. For real though, I'm mortified. I don't make a lot of money. I was never warned at any point this would be an issue. RH just let me do it, and I didn't have margin on, it was money I set aside. I thought it was fine to mill a few hundred bucks.",1639182360.0

11497,Outrages predictions 2022 US inflation reaches above 15% on wage-price spiral,rdlng7,"
**Summary: By the fourth quarter of 2022, US CPI 
inflation reaches an annualized 15% as companies bid 
up wages in an effort to find willing and qualified 
workers, triggering a wage-price spiral unlike anything 
seen since the 1970’s.**

At the end of the 1960s, the US Federal Reserve and 
the Fed chair then, McChesney Martin, misjudged 
how hot they could run the US labour market without 
fanning inflation. The miscue paved the way for inflation 
expectations getting out of control and a massive 
wage-price spiral the following decade. The official US 
CPI reached a peak at 11.8% in February 1975. It wasn’t 
until the recession of 1980-82 and brutal policy rate 
increases to levels as high as 20% that inflation was 
finally killed.


In 2022, the Federal Reserve and Fed chair Jerome Powell 
repeats the same mistake all over again as the post-Covid 
outbreak economy and especially the labour market 
are severely supply constrained, making a mockery of 
the Fed’s traditional models. 

Powell believes millions of 
Americans will return to work and fill some of the 10.4 
million open job positions as Covid-19 fades. But this is 
plain wrong. Some have retired early due to the crisis 
and thus have permanently left the US workforce. The 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates the exodus of 
older workers to be about 3 million people. Others aren’t 
returning to poorly paid jobs after seeing huge handouts 
during the pandemic and seem to be waiting for better 
jobs and pay.


The big difference between today and yesterday is that 
the pandemic has fuelled a great awakening of workers. 
Across sectors and income classes they realise they are 
now more empowered than ever. They demand a better 
experience: better job conditions, higher wages, more 
flexibility and a sense of purpose from work.

 Coupled 
with persistent inflationary pressures coming from the 
production side, the energy crisis and labour shortage, 
this results in unprecedented broad-based double-digit 
annualised wage increases by Q4. As a consequence, US 
inflation reaches an annualised pace above 15% before 
the start of 2023, for the first time since WWII. This 
prompts the Federal Reserve into a too-little, too-late 
move to tighten monetary policy faster in a desperate 
effort to tame inflation. But the central bank has lost 
credibility; it will take time to regain it.

markets. The JNK high-yield ETF falls as much as 20% and

11499,Coinbase Will Steal Your Imaginary Girlfriend,rdlk5t,"Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong.  He's the son of Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) and cousin to Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day).  $COIN is the largest code currency exchange in the United States by trading volume.

**Who uses Coinbase?**

Coinbase is in 100+ countries, and they have over 73 million verified users. Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) was at 7.4M.  They have $255B of assets on the platform.  Compare to RH, 22.4M funded accounts and $95B of assets on the platform.

**How do they make money?**

Last quarter they had $1.235B in net revenue, including $1.1B from transactions and $145M in subscription & services revenue.  The transactions revenue is really driven by code currency volatility, but the services revenue is sticky and fast growing.

**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**

* Coinbase will be a hodler of non-fiat currency.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.
* Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.  [https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce](https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce)
* Coinbase issued $2B in debt at <4% APR for product development and potential M&A
* They announced a partnership with Facebook. They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.

* Kevin Durant signed a deal to promote Coinbase
* And plenty of other innovation... browser extension, ledger integration, etc.

**So what?**

**Buy the stock! Sell puts!** 

* Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau rates Coinbase as an Outperform with a $444 price target.
* Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Senior Equity Analyst, re-iterated her $600 PT on Coinbase.
* Josh Brown likes it.  Kevin O'Leary likes it.  Bryn Talkington likes it.

Why wouldn't they?  The company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.

Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized. The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term.

11550,Electric Vehicles: A Bubble to be Burst?,rdk347,"https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/electric-vehicles-a-bubble-to-be-burst

Electric vehicles represent more than just a break from gasoline-powered modes of transportations; they illustrate the extremely high demand from consumers for further innovation. The electric vehicle industry, which now has a total market cap of nearly $1.3 trillion, has boomed with investments, in part due to Tesla's major success under the leadership of Elon Musk. However, this everlasting supply of interest seems to indicate that the industry as a whole may be in a bubble. We will look at recent news with regards to other EV companies as well as macroeconomic trends to give a proper diagnosis. 

	Rivian is an American electric vehicle maker that was founded in 2009 and went public through an IPO on November 10th at $100 per share. This has led Rivian stock ($RIVN) to reach a market cap of $116 billion, which is absurd considered the company has not earned any revenue yet. This large valuation is due in part to the success of Tesla, which has effectively skyrocketed to a global brand; investors ultimately are banking on Rivian's buz within the EV space. Their  growth projections are carrying the stock price to new heights, which leaves room for a sizeable correction if they do not meet their future plans.

	Rivian has a variety of future objectives on their agenda that correspond with this seemingly overvalued price, such asproducing 25,000 vans per year by 2025 and building a manufacturing plant in Europe to start building vehicles by 2024. If they are unable to complete these goals that are the basis for investors piling cash into the company, then the company will subsequently see a major correction. The situation with Rivian is very reminiscient of the early 2000s bubble, where firms where being propped up on the market not on the basis of financial analysis or profits, but on hype. 


	Although the fad of electric vehicles is not going anywhere anytime soon, the vast majority of the solely EV firms may eventually gain new competitors in the form of industry giants. GM has invested $35 billion in EV product development for new vehicles, while other manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz have announced brand new lineups for electric vehicles for 2022. Only time will tell whether secondary EV companies such as Rivian, Lucid Motors, and Nio will be able to scale as far as Tesla in regards to revenue and valuation.",1639174264.0

11565,$PYPL is extremely undervalued at $188.,rdjrjq,"$PYPL has seen an extreme sell off in the last 3 months. It was hovering $270s in October and now it sits at the $180s.

This sell off was **uncalled for**. This is almost guaranteed to skyrocket back up, but first let’s talk about why it sold off. 

“Bad” [earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/11/09/paypal-stock-having-worst-day-in-20-months-on-disappointing-forecast.html)

*""We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base, consumer confidence is weakened with the absence of stimulus payments, and with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in-store,"" Schulman said on the call.*

Well it’s a good thing the supply chain issue is clearing up and that on Black Friday, $PYPL saw a 400% increase on their [buy now, pay later](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/volumes-on-paypals-buy-now-pay-later-platform-jump-400-report?amp) selection. This means people are shopping in person and using PayPal, and most likely indicates people will be using this all month. 

Don’t wanna shop in person? Well in 2022 people can use [venmo](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/volumes-on-paypals-buy-now-pay-later-platform-jump-400-report?amp) to pay for their Amazon orders. Who gives a fuck about eBay getting rid of PayPal when Amazon takes its place. Sounds bullish as fuck to me. 

Do not underestimate how popular Venmo is, among the young crowd it is THE platform people use in 2021. 

While you may think PYPL is a boomer stock, it moves quicker than you think. Go look at last year from December to February. It went up $100+ in only 2 months. 

Not to mention next earnings will be post holidays, and I bet they’ll be bullish as fuck.

11599,DocuSign ($DOCU) V-Shaped Recovery IMMINENT,rdirad,"Hello fellow retards. As we all are aware, DocuSign ($DOCU) plummeted from the $230s to the $130s last Friday due to their mixed earnings report. However, their earnings report was not even that bad. They beat expected revenue, but missed expected billings by 3.7%. The market overreacted and sold off the stock like crazy. Most people think DocuSign is just another stock that suckled from the tits of the covid pandemic, but I believe its relevance and use are here to stay. I've had to use DocuSign on several occasions, even before the pandemic, to sign forms for housing and jobs.

Now, I believe what we will see happen with this stock from now into early next year is a huge buying frenzy. It's actually already begun. Here's the reasons why:

1. Cathie Wood bought the dip last Friday (12/3).
2. Their CEO (Dan Springer) disclosed to the SEC a purchase of 33,675 DocuSign shares ($4.8 million).
3. The RSI is currently at 24.07 (heavily oversold). This indicates the perfect opportunity to ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".

My recommendation to is buy in on Monday when the market opens. If you're skeptical, at the very least, put this on your watch list. Pay attention to the volume trends. This will give you a good idea of when to establish a position and let it run up. This stock is meant to be stay above $200. We will see it return there very soon.

11655,Ford is the Apple of the car industry.,rdhemp,"I’ve seen it said a few times that Tesla is the “apple of the car industry” and while no such thing exists(no automaker will ever organically match Apple’s divine profit margin) if there was an “apple of the car industry” it would be Ford. 

The reason being that, while Tesla has a lot of brand recognition within the EV space, if EVs are going to takeover(as they would have to for Tesla to even approach being worth what it currently trades at) then the EV industry will simply be the car industry, with the gas/diesel segment being the niche component. This transition will make Ford king. 

Branding:

Although teslas upside down penis has made great strides in recent years, the blue oval itself is a brand Americans know and love, and their individual products also represent some of the most powerful brands in the car industry. If the iPhone is the king of smartphones, then who is the king of trucks? The f150. Just like the iPhone, there’s other offerings, some arguably better and cheaper than the f150, but in terms of brand and market recognition f150 is the top dog. Same story with the Mustang and to a lesser extent the Explorer. All you have to do is look at the bronco sport to see the power of branding in the automotive industry. It’s a rebadged Ford Escape with new stamping yet it sells like hot cakes because it shares a name with the traditional bronco. Don’t underestimate the power of Ford’s brands.
 
Product:

Now, let’s talk product. I am from Tennessee, and around here it’s somewhat popular to make jokes at the expense of electric cars. But I think once the F150 lighting is on the road it’s going to put the kibosh on that. If the Lightning does everything they say it’ll do at the price point they’re advertising now, it’ll be a juggernaut, and since it isn’t a door Tesla’s douche-mobile cybertruck won’t be able to stop it. You simply can’t argue with a vehicle that hauls ass like a sports car and hauls junk like a truck.

And Fords gas cars aren’t anything to sleaze at either. The new Bronco took Jeep behind the barn in record time and their only response is an overpriced, 12mpg box on wheels to compete with the expedition/navigator. Also, they’re slowly but surely rebuilding the Lincoln brand with great interiors and attractive exterior styling. After what they were putting out pre-2017, it’ll take a while to reposition themselves but they will do it if they consistently invest in the brand as they have been. Meanwhile, the normal F150 continues to print money. 

The issues:

It’s often that people who are fans of a particular car manufacturer will fail to acknowledge any possible flaw in their pick, but obviously Ford isn’t perfect. Their main two issues are dealerships and unions. I think at some point they will bite the bullet and start aggressively fighting to get rid of the dealerships. They’ll never lose the unions obviously but it’s only a matter of time before Tesla starts dealing with them and then Ford will be competitive on price or even be able to beat Telsa.

TLDR: be a boomer. buy Ford stock. embrace it. They have the most powerful brands and a great product. The competition is lackluster and their management is strong.",1639167091.0
11656,FIGS is the next LULU,rdhemf,"Once again people, this is not DD.  DD involves actual work.  Research.  Reading a bunch of words and then changing them into your own words.  What I'm extremely talented at is looking at the 10000 foot view.  But don't listen to me because I can't give financial advice.  My previous posts have been negative.  I called CHWY a dog when it was trading at $75 (I wish I'd had my eyes open when it was at $150).  I've predicted the demise of PTON.  This time I'm turning positive.

Boring.  Old school.  Medical scrubs.  Nobody thinks about them.  Unless you're one of the 22 million health care workers in the US.  Up until recently they wore ugly, loose fitting uncomfortable medical scrubs.  Along comes FIGS and starts making nice looking comfortable scrubs that are aspirational.  Ask the nurse in your life and you'll probably hear them say ""yeah, Figs, I'm going to get myself those for christmas"".  They cost 3 times as much (feel free to fact check that) but they're what all of the health care workers want.

Full disclosure, I'm a bag holder.  I think I bought 500 shares at around $38 and another 1000 at like $34  I have 10 put contracts for $30 that i'll get put on next week by the looks of things but I'm OK with that.  Today their stock is down like 20% because the CFO they hired last year at this time resigned.  Not sure why, it could be something big it could be that he just ""wants to spend more time with his family"" but this is a real company that is making a real product that has the opportunity to improve the lives of 22 million people in the USA alone by making them look better and feel better while they're working so I think it's worth the investment.

11685,$CLF: A Wonderful Money Maker That Wall Street Hates 🚀🚀🦾🦾,rdgp7v,"What's up apes? It's getting fucking exhausting for investors in Cleveland-Cliffs at this point, but this company prints money (EPS of 2.35, $6bn in revenue in Q3), the outlook is good, and the market just absolutely hates this stock for some reason. Every single piece of good news seems to not matter, nor do their insanely low valuations (currently 2.5x book value), ability to pay down debt, and their presence as an inflation hedge (look today- CPI shows 7% inflation. Stock is -4.5%).

There are shouts about ""peak steel,"" but, as CEO Lourenco Goncalves said on their [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/), about 45% of their 2022 revenue is tied up in contracts that have already been signed at these high prices. The only thing that will truly tank them is if the steel market completely collapses. Given record demand, the infrastructure bill passing, and Chinese exports slowing, that does not seem likely.

There has truly been no bad news about this company for ages. But every single ding the market takes, CLF gets hit harder. Just look at the bleeds over the past six months.

Crayons:

RSI currently at 40. Stock below 200 and 50 DMAs but still over $1 away from a death cross. The DMAs are bearish signals... and completely untethered from reality.

I expected this stock to be in the 30s by now. Instead we have a 33% discount, and I keep adding. I don't know who the fuck is still selling/shorting this stock at this price; I'm certainly not.

A sustained breakout is long overdue. CLF still +40% YTD but it is flat since the end of March, insanely.

This was an incredible opportunity months ago. It's even better now.

11751,Why the Santa Rally is still coming,rdeyj9,"The stock market is basically perfectly correlated to the fed's balance sheet. And what we know is that the fed balance sheet has some cyclical moves due to the nature of its asset purchases/natural roll off of its bond book/coupons.

https://preview.redd.it/dpk843zk9r481.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e91beee40430ab82c63398a24bc0a70b0181e7c

Here it is in the past few months, you can see the drops were almost perfectly timed with drops in the fed balance sheet due to roll-off of its book and a recovery comes back nearly perfectly as the fed continues its purchases.

https://preview.redd.it/mw7pxbwear481.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b67a6d337324bacd9d6b41cec0a09b4c5d486f

So what does that mean? Well the fed is suppose to taper in December, by reducing purchases from USD120 billion to USD105 billion. However, there is another USD30-45 billion of additional buying due rolling the balance sheet in the next several weeks. If you look at the fed data, the bulk of the fed's buying happen in the 2nd/3rd/4th week of the month and the 1st and last week of the month are drawdown periods of the book (where bonds roll off/get paid off). So in the next several week, we are looking 130 billion or so of incremental liquidity coming to the market. That alone should drive stocks to all time highs until christmas, we may see then some cool-down between the period of Christmas/new year as that is a period liquidity rolls-off.

\-AAPL now is expecting to grow at 1-4% YOY and trades 30-60% above it's average valuation (31PE);

\-Demand has been pulled forward years in advance, and its the kind of demand that is not re-occurring. You don't buy a new Macbook every year and the Iphone's hardly change at this point;

\-Even the AAPL car at best would bring in 10 Billion by 2026. The market cap is 3 trillion NOW, it's insignificant and laughable;

\-China is imploding with real estate being 25% of GDP they are going into a harsh recession now that Evergrande has defaulted. AAPL sales will likely decline.

\-WSB has presented Wallstreet with a once in a life time opportunity. Wallstreet invests a massive amount of money in AAPL and FAANG since they have huge market caps that allow them to store a vast amount of their wealth into. Wallstreet knows this bull market is coming to an end and now WSB is allowing them to exit their positions into the hands of retail investors.

I’ve noticed this daily and don’t know what sense to make out of it since there is buying pressure. 

Additionally, my TA results in C&H formation on 1hr,2hr,4hr and daily. Also the chart shows a gap to be filled around 226-212. There is a lot of bullish sentiment but price action does not match the TA and share bought.

11832,Why buy a trashed stock like VZ about now?,rdcz04,"Antique trader POV

Years ago, I realized that after hot stocks I was chasing had topped they made a shape that looked like the  outline of Batman's head.  

Eventually I learned that the two ""ears"" on  the head shape were called a ""Double top"" and the psychology of the market was that buyers were reaching a ""this is as high as we buy"" decision which created that pattern repeatedly over the course of a  stock topping.

Of course, it didn't take long for me to look for an ""Upside down Batman Head"" to see if that was a thing too.  Well, duh,  that is called a ""Double Bottom"" ... and again the psychology is simple  -- the two ears are the flash point where Sellers decide, ""this is a  cheap as we will sell.""

I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed ... so it took a lot of repeats for me to start to actually try to avoid the fall off the head of a ""Batman"" and to become patient enough to look for the upside down head and ears that meant I could actually be buying cheap.

 Verizon, I believe is creating the ""Head"" portion of the upside down bottoming ""Upside down Batman head.""  Now, if this really is the bottom for VZ, there will probably be that slow arc off the lows, followed by the flash down that stays above the previous low -- the second ""Batman Ear""

But it sure feels like we are close to getting some upside down Batman VZ head...

12013,UWMC - Who wears short shorts? SI ⬆️ Borrow fee ⬆️ : ... Shares on loan ⬆️ .,rd8nep,"Another public service announcement regarding the daisy dukers playing UWMC. It bears mentioning:

The latest Fintel short data shows an average of 5 days to cover, 32.63% borrow rate, and only 3,000 shares left to borrow. That means as of just today at least an additional +97k short shares are now out on loan at a borrow rate over 30%.

Shorts are basically thrusting both their middle fingers up. The short interest on the free float for this stock also increased to 14% of the total float. Most of this can be attributed to the move pulled by market makers to short the stock price to the ground in preparation to purchase shares cheaply from UWMC as part of an offering intended to increase the public float.  

There was just one problem: UWM CEO Mat Ishbia saw that he was being played and decided this ain't a game, so he canceled the offering and announced accelerated buy backs instead lol 

To those of us who can read in between the lines, this was basically a financial ""screw you,"" as this marked the point where shorts got in the hole, as marked by the short interest rate sky rocketing from less than 1% a couple of weeks ago to the rate that it is now (over 32%).

I'm not suggesting anything from any of this information, but I do want to put it out on a forum where everyone can see exactly what's happening and decide for themselves if daisy dukes look better worn high waisted, pockets out, or both.

12015,Inflation countdown! 10 minutes! (8:30 ET) + My guess,rd8hu3,"I took some time to make the graph EXCEPT I don't have enough time to get my estimation of inflation. Data is sourced from Trading Economics.

Used car prices are form Manheim with a 1 month delay. Energy prices are also 1 month delayed. + Food.

It looks to me Energy prices might be starting to slow during November. It'll still rise though. However, MAYBE it shouldn't rise dramatically. THOUGH NOT SURE!! (I'm still not sure on the delay time interval.......... I just did a 1 month average.........)

Rather Used Car Prices seem to be problematic - a possible steep rise. (Also not sure on the time delay interval... I did 1M, but articles say 1-2-3 month delays are possible!)

Food prices are hard - I couldn't find data on say restaurant avg prices, Uber Eats etc. I'm going to assume due to the Great Resignation / Anti Work + the bad new job openings data presumably food prices might go up - above is just commodity prices...

Shelter data / rent data is sourced from ApartmentList. I didn't put a delay.

All in all - it's most likely clear inflation is above last month's 6.2% Year on Year. **The question is by how much.**

Looking at the graph and eyeballing it, energy costs skyrocketed a lot, causing the bulk of the October increase from 5.4% (+0.8% - 0.9% seasonally adjusted). Assuming the energy increase accounted for the most, the October jump seems much more less. However used cars seem to go up. If you add them both up, it's possible inflation once again could theoretically reach 6.2 + 0.6/0.7 or so maybe 6.8% or 6.9% or so. BUT these are just eyeballing guesses........

You can see energy prices in December seem to be going backwards so that's a good sign.

12045,New Twitter CEO's first action was to increase censorship; banning the Nancy Pelosi Portfolio Tracker amongst other accounts,rd7570,"Just days after Jack Dorsey's resignation as CEO of Twitter, Parag Agrawal is pushing for increased censorship on negative topics regarding certain US elites. With Dorsey - known to be an avid opponent of censorship on the platform - gone, Twitter seems to have gone into an entirely new direction.

The topic is covered extensively on [Breaking Points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcUhYKEcZ-8), mentioning the suspension of the Nancy Pelosi Portfolio Tracker - which did nothing more than give an objective overview of Pelosi's trades - as well as accounts covering the Ghislaine Maxwell trials.

What do you think will be the effect of this shift in company policy on the business? Will it kick off a decline in the platform's popularity as users move away from censorship or will it allow them to increase profits as it gets policy makers on their side?",1639137701.0

It dropped off the planet and dropped from 24-16$ in a day or 2 for no reason at all. I value this stock from anywhere from 24-38 dollars on the high and low side. There is no way I will not be investing at the 18 dollar strike price. Guns are going no where. I’m gonna have my second amendment for a while. Until we come out with guns from Star Wars one of the most famous gun brands is here to stay and is here for profit. Their profit margins are great as well. This is not a degenerative play this is a actually investment that will provide good returns as a single stock. Also if you want to place some 30$ calls and make a big baller play go right ahead I can’t tell you what to do.

- The stock tested the level on the two subsequent trading days, which created a bullish triple bottom pattern on the daily chart.

- The stock has a relatively low float of 82.98 million shares and 67.09% are held by insiders and institutions. C3.ai also has 17.46%, meaning 12.88 million shares, of its float held short although the number has decreased slightly from the 13.79 million shares held short in October. The institutions want to buy this bad boy very much.
- The stock has resistance above at $36.52 and $43 and support at $32 and the all-time low.
- Traded all the way up to 42 after hours due to $500 million government contract.

- Beat the last earnings report with 58.2 mil revenue and -0.23 EPS. 
- Downgraded by several institutions the next day.
-  Revenue grew by 28.7% over the past year
- Revenue is forecast to grow 31.82% per year

- Debt free.  AI has not had any debt for past 5 years. 

- On the bad side: 

- The stock has been performing horribly, down 69% since IPO. Maybe it’s good?
- The operating expenses are increasing, although they put a good chunk of it into RnD.
- Currently unprofitable and not forecast to become profitable over the next 3 years
- Significant insider selling over the past 3 months

12168,"Will inflation beat forecast , and will inflation become transitory again? I think so…",rd1703,"Just a dumb ape… don’t listen to me. Just buy some SPY calls…

Here’s why. The DRY or Baltic Dry Index. The DRY basically tracks the shipping cost of dry goods or freight. It can be an indicator of inflation. The type of inflation we’re experiencing is due to several things, surge in demand, lack of labor, and the ongoing supply chain issues, including shipping of goods. We all remember the story of all those ships waiting outside of San Francisco. We’ll, ships waiting are down 30% (and I don’t care about their new counting model, what matters is the amount of ships anchored within 40 miles because that’s how it was counted in September and October…).

With the assumption that this inflationary period is in-part caused by the supply chain, we can deduce that part of the inflation rate should be subject to the supply chain constraints. We’ll, shipping has been by far one of the biggest supply chain hurdles for this pandemic rebound. 

Don’t just take my word for it. Read this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/inflation-definition-cause-stock-market-11637623703

And this https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002?st=uw2xw7xi63b9w14&reflink=article_copyURL_share

So where is this going? Let’s compare inflation rates this year to the DRY. 

This chart is inflation and we can see that it really took off around April.

[Inflation Rate](https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/united-states-inflation-cpi.png?s=cpi+yoy&v=202111101347V20200908&ismobile=1&w=400&h=250&lbl=0&d1=20201210)

Then take a look at chart at the DRY. 

https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.Dry

The Dry started to take off in April. So, did inflation. The DRY peaked in October. We’ll, inflation was the highest since the early 1990’s. I think this is a leading indicator that inflation has peaked. If this is true, then CPI can actually be lower in tomorrows November report, and certainly in Decembers report. Depending on how much lower it is, say it’s back to 5.5 ish, I think JPOW will reintroduce the obligatory “inflation is transitory” phrase that has kept rising interest rates away and the Christmas rally continues.

Moral to this story is that there may be some good news tomorrow. But really, I’m just trying to make myself feel better about these spy calls I’m holding…",1639113784.0

12243,Do you all realize how deep this goes???,rcy65r,"Ever since GME happened I have learned _so much_ about the world of finance from all of the incredibly well-researched, intelligent, and informed DD posted by apes on reddit. Of course at this point everybody knows about DRSing your shares because it's the only way to actually own your shares and that everybody else in the entire financial market who _doesn't_ DRS their shares is an idiot. We know that.

But I'm not sure all of you understand just how deep this all goes.

It's one thing for **them** to pull this funny money crap with _stocks_, which are barely even a real thing anyway. But did you know that **they** are even pulling tricks with your hard-earned _cash_???

That's right, you might think that cold hard cash is a simple thing to keep track of. And of course the typical normie thinks that when you deposit your cash in a bank account the bank holds the cash in your name. BUT I HAVE UNCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE!! The very same bank that _you_ are currently trusting with your cash is currently doing things like:

* Mixing it with all their other cash and showing it on their balance sheets  
* Lending that cash out - to just anybody! - even the hedgies who are currently shorting your shares  
* Earning interest which doesn't all come back to you

**Do you know where your cash is right now?** You may think you do, but you don't. It could be anywhere, it could even be going to Citadel or something. That's right. What an atrocity.

I know this is a lot for me to dump on you here, but don't worry - I have a solution. That's right. I am starting the first-ever service where ANY fellow ape can **Direct Register Your Cash**.

ALL you have to do is send me a DM with your full name, social security number and bank account number to initiate the process. Then, call up your bank and demand to send _all_ of your cash via a wire transfer to my new company. The rep on the phone may ask you questions like ""do you know who you're sending your money to"" and ""are you aware that this transfer is not reversible?"" Don't worry - it's just a script that they have to read because the damn hedgies are desperate to keep their scam going.

Once you've sent me your cash, I promise to _personally_ register every bill and coin in _your_ name by stamping each one with all the personal info you send me, thereby ensuring that you are directly in control of your cash. For a small fee, I will send you a picture of your stamped cash, and for an additional small fee, you can continue to acquire more cash and send it to your account with me.

12366,Inflation Rotation,rcud4h,"Inflation and the Omicron variant are likely to be the two topics that dominate the Federal Reserve meeting next week, and any decisions made could dictate where investors choose to put their money for the time being. 

Although there has been a bit of shift in sentiment over the last month or so, tech shares have slightly outperformed most other sectors this year. However, this could change in 2022 depending on which headline the Fed sees as more important. 

On one hand, if the new coronavirus strain is deemed to be a significant obstacle that could result in new restrictions, they could hold their current policy stance, or maybe even delay next year’s rate hike to support the economy. Should this be the case, tech shares and “stay-at-home” stocks that prospered during the height of the pandemic could get a boost and drag the tech-heavy  indices higher. 

However, if tomorrow’s CPI print is as strong, the Federal Reserve may elect to begin tapering faster, opening the door for an earlier rate hike next year. This might trigger a larger shift into safer assets, including higher dividend yielding value stocks such as utilities and consumer staples. 

The rotation of funds over the next weeks is definitely something to keep an eye on over the next few weeks. Next week’s Fed decision could present a number of different trading opportunities through sector-themed ETFs. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, so it’s important to closely follow any developments and understand the situation before making any decisions.",1639092727.0

First, the velocity of money is near an all time low. Here’s a graph from the fed on the velocity of money (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). Velocity is a measure of how many times a dollar changes hands per quarter. Traditionally it’s been well above 1 and sometimes over 2, but nowadays it’s only around 1. This means more people are hoarding cash than ever before because they’re not sure what to invest in. I think because of people’s fears over covid and recessions, they excessively hoard cash which makes the velocity of money so low. 

Why does this matter? Let’s review the quantity theory of money or MV = PQ. For people who can’t do math, money printer go brrr but inflation is not super high because people don’t spend the money. The fed feels comfortable printing money because the velocity of money is so low. If people excessively save and never spend, there won’t be hyperinflation. Therefore I don’t think the fed is ever going to raise interest rates that significantly. 

Someone else pointed out earlier that a record amount of money was put into the market at the last omicron dip— $6.7 billion (https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/investors-buy-the-dip-7-billion-stocks-etfs-omicron-selloff-2021-12?utm_campaign=sf-bi-main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&fbclid=IwAR240epgL9Eb8KrcECzfGfZ-QDVmejAcbrJvCvwNvDTUwfoTa4TuuSRi-1s). I think this is proof to me that the low velocity of money means people are saving and waiting for this kind of opportunity to invest. With the amount of cash lying around in the economy not being spent, people are just going to keep buying the dip at every opportunity forever. The market **can’t** tank because people are saving so much money that they’ll keep buying the dip. 

Tl;dr people are saving too much money, so the fed can brrr forever and others will always buy the dip, making the bull run last forever",1639088359.0

12470,FARLEY AND FORD ARE NOT FUCKING AROUND.,rcr8bh,"First off, I’m in this YOLO straight options (because I want to get rich not invest long term). I posted this in r/stocks, but as you all know they’re a bit pretentious and would rather debate back and forth than actually have the balls to risk on 20% profitability to make half a million dollars. Here is the play I am putting all my eggs in one basket on (as famously said by some douche bag about Tesla in 2019 on WSB). 

Ford (F). I think we’re several months away from a massive realization that Ford is an EV competitor, but most importantly the potential dominator in a specific EV field: Trucks. With a market cap of 80B I opened a quite aggressive position projecting them to hit 240B by end of 2022. Concept vehicles and speculation drive the EV space with Ford actually having the capacity to do one thing: produce. I’ve consolidated my thesis into 3 major targets. 

1. Ford is going to rebrand themselves as a technology company over the next year, they’ve done this with wild statements like getting into semi conductor production, their recent large investment overseas, and just several days ago their pairing with Salesforce, as of today Bill Ford executed 20 million in stock options on Ford. I think Farley and the team recognize that rebranding to a tech company elicits larger valuation beyond being an automaker. 

2. Obviously, the F-150 and EV sales. They’ve easily posted YoY doubles in EV sales, the current Mach-E is back ordered and sold out, and Farley announced today that F-150 orders are company capped at 200,000. Meaning they are not actually estimating true pre-order interest as Tesla did with the Cybertruck. Also notably, they’ve launched a new hybrid model of a new smaller truck the Maverick, which is unable to be stocked at dealerships due to demand, and back ordered through 2023. 

3. The biggest piece nobody is realizing is Ford supplies the largest adoption of vehicles to the local and federal government. The government has already passed one, and working on the second bill that is designating massive cash to the EV and transportation sector. If you think Ford is not first in-line to access these funds, you’re insane. Additionally Ford EV’s will have access to tax rebates of over 7,000 next year. 

Ford is going to literally do what Tesla did in 2019, fill the news with monthly reports of how their EV growth month over month, quarter over quarter, is doubling. I’m speculating that competitors as well are not going to be able to transition and offer actual supply to compete until later years, 2023-2024 IF they ever achieve that capacity. Ford and Farley are not fucking around.

Positions (since mod bot keeps fucking deleting them)

12518,I think PTON is worth about $7 per share,rcqeac," 

Right up front, this not real DD. I suck at that. The last time I made a call I said that CHWY was a dog (no pun intended) and I got completely shat on so feel free to continue with that. I was told that I have a small brain but as I pointed out at the time and I'm happy to re-iterate, I compensate for that with my full wallet.

My premise here is that PTON sells a product that people don't really want but had to buy during the pandemic. It was the cool sexy new toy that is now flooding craigslist and kijiji classifieds. It's not worthless but it should be compared with its main competitors in home gym equipment - Nautilus and Nordic Track. Now comes the shit DD...

Nautilus trades at 1.05 x sales PTON is a lofty 9.06

Nautilus trades at 3.6 x book PTON is at 21.2

This despite the fact that Nautilus actually made money when they had the chance but PTON just blew their wad and churned out another big loss.

As for Nordic Track, they planned on going public with a $6 Billion valuation but pulled the IPO. If they're not worth $6B I'm not sure how PTON is worth $15B.

So, I had to pick a number and I put everything from $0 (they're burning through their cash and adding to their debt - I've run a pretty decent business and I know that that's a bad model even for a ""growth"" company) to $17 per share (the valuation that nordic track was looking to get) onto a big wheel and I spun it and it came out at $7 per share.

I already have $30 puts for 03/22 and my next move is $20p 01/23. I'd buy $10 but they aren't available. yet.

oh, and if anyone takes this as financial advice, they're not very smart.",1639081525.0

12637,"CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations",rcn7p4,"There were some good DD posted, so I just filed in some gaps and provided another opinion. Not Financial Advice, burn money at your own risk.

**TL;DR - negative sentiments, high short interest, crowd favorite. Probably down, but shrek is still in the vicinity.**

**Ticker - Chewy (CHWY)**

**Price - 57$**

**Earnings - 12/09/2021 AH**

**Category - Digital Retail**

**Macro - Mixed, Logistics (expensive fulfillment)  vs Sentiments (people love pets)**

**Macro + Fundamental**

Chewy has been a covid winner due to stay-at-home increasing the rate of pet adoption. However, as a retailer, Chewy faces the same problems of logistical bottlenecks and increased labor costs due to their focus on quality distribution and fulfillment. Chewy is traded on its massive revenue and user growth, rather than a measure of its PE. Chewy’s problem here is twofold: first, despite the massive revenue, Chewy typically loses money per quarter. Second is the stagnating pet-adoption post-peak. Given its slow drain of sub 25 million per quarter and a cash balance of over 500m, I believe there is little risk of dilution. The key metrics to look at are: Gross margins, Customer numbers, and total lifetime-value (LTV)

**Technical**

PC ratio volume is at 1.57 and PC ratio OI is about 1.36 both of which are bearish. RSI is about 30, oversold. Implied movement about 24% or about $15. Short interest is 20% of float, with 3.4 days to cover. Given the magnitude of the last few months for Chewy, I believe a reasonable support lies at 40, or the March 2020 initial buying. Fib retracement at current levels are very difficult to pin and not considered. Given the high short interest, a gap up to 70 is likely on a positive beat and raise, with topside target being 80$.

**Sentimental**

Everyone think its overvalued due to its sky high PE and lack of consistent profitability. While I agree its an optics issue, Amazon was not profitable for a long time though they were growing revenue very quickly. However, there is a high chance of stagnation, as lease for this quarter, on revenue growth due to the stagnation of pet adoptions. Recently, CHWY partnered up with Trupanion for pet insurance that will roll out spring 2022. This is a great move to improve revenue and monetize the user-base while not providing the insurance infrastructure themselves. SA quant rating is 2.62 out of 5. SA Author ratings slightly better at 3.5. Wall Street Ratings at 3.9, with price target average of about 93$, highest being 133 and lowest being 51. This also opens up for downgrades if performance is lackluster. Twitter is mostly negative, as is stockwits and wallstreetbets. (this means retail is predominately bearish)

**Given the high short interest, shorting calls/call spreads feel dangerous. Selling puts at the 40 level feels like the baseline play. IV is high enough to negate a lot of profitability for lesser movements, so net sell is logical. For those that want to play downside, I suggest a 12/17 put debit spread.**

As best practice - if you're selling options for earnings, wait til 10 minutes before closing to do so to maximize IV and negate intra-day movements. If net buy, set levels and buy at levels.

**Don’t most SPACs suck?** Yes, most deSPACs suck but the ones that don’t like DKNG, QS, LCID have huge upside.

**Why is this different?** There are only two public companies working on the next generation of solid state batteries to power future EVs and other tech; Quantumscape ($QS) and Solid Power. Solid Power went public at a very attractive price putting it at about 1/5th the valuation of Quantumscape.

**What exactly are Solid Power’s selling points?**

Solid Power is making a “New Breed of Battery”, namely solid state batteries, primarily for Electric Vehicles (“EVs”). They have been in R&D mode for the last 8 years, are now ramping towards production, and will be the first to commercial production using existing lithium battery manufacturing facilities. 

The advantages of moving to solid state batteries are many but some main ones include:

* Double the range of current batteries
* More than double the life of current batteries
* Non-volatile (they don’t catch on fire during accidents like current batteries)
* Cheaper to manufacture at scale
* Their batteries do not use Cobalt which is currently being cornered by aggressive Chinese acquisitions

What is even more exciting are their partners and investors

Ford has committed to a joint venture with Solid Power and plans to eventually incorporate their batteries into its EVs. Ford is projecting that it will be producing 600,000 EVs by 2023 (Source: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5)) making Ford the second largest EV producer after Tesla.

BMW may also soon be a completely electric vehicle company with Germany planning to phase out all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 (Source: [https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars](https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars))

**Does the government have some involvement here?**

Glad you asked. It's not only the private sector that loves Solid Power. Solid Power was spun out of a DARPA project and the government really wants this tech ASAP to counter Chinese control of the battery market. As such the U.S government has given them multiple grants and contracts going back to 2013 to fund their R&D in the hopes of incorporating solid state batteries into future defense and space systems (Source: [https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table](https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table)). The new infrastructure bill also includes $6 billion allocated towards battery infrastructure which is a potential pot of money Solid Power can access to turbo boost their R&D.

**Why is Everyone Excited About Batteries?**

Morgan Stanley has said that “Batteries Are the New Oil” and with our rapidly approaching electric future I can’t help but agree. As more and more of our infrastructure runs off batteries the companies that control this resource will be the new providers of energy in the future replacing the Exxons and BPs of today. The EV market has a TAM of $300B at 50% penetration and $600B at 100% EV penetration as projected to take place in 2035. The most exciting of these companies and the one with the most advanced technology, in my opinion, is Solid Power and we have a real gift being handed to us here being able to get into this thing early and on the ground floor of the future here. Solid Power is already lined up to provide the batteries for future EVs from Ford and BMW as well as the major Korean brands via it’s joint venture with SK (more on that later).

**How does Solid Power compare to the competition** 

The company that most people are aware of in this space since it went public first is of course Quantumscape ($QS). There are two ways to compare Quantumscape and Solid Power, first by their respective technologies and second by how they are currently trading in the market and by both these measures Solid Power is a clear winner.

* Quantumscape only tested their batteries to 800 cycles, while Solid Power tested theirs to 1000, and at 45 degrees Celsius as opposed to Quantumscape’s 25 degrees Celsius while maintaining >80% capacity retention.
* Solid Power has recorded 650 cycles with a 2C-rate fast charge occurring during every fifth cycle in near room-temperature conditions, whereas most of Quantumscape’s published numbers were only performed at <=1C rates, suggesting that Solid Power batteries are more efficient at quick-charging, as much as twice as efficient. Quick charging is a huge requirement for battery technology.
* Quantumscape is struggling with at-scale production and rollout strategies, whereas Solid Power is going to market with those problems solved and partners in place to hit the ground running. Solid Power will have its batteries in Ford EVs in 2022 for initial testing.

The nice thing about Quantumscape going public first is it gives us a look at how receptive the market is to a solid state battery play.

I made this chart prior to the merger and am too lazy to update it but as you can see we are following it nicely.

As we can see from the $QS chart it also meandered along around $12 going into merger before rocketing to a high of $114.77 and then eventually settling in the $20 - $40 range.

Solid Power is going public at a pro-forma enterprise value of $1.2B at $10 per share. That means that $QS post merger valuation is trading at a 10x premium to $SLDP pre-merger and some simple math would then tell us that for $SLDP to trade at market cap parity to $QS the stock would need to rise to **$100 per share, a 10x return** from its merger price. 

Another major competitor to Solid Power is SK Innovation, the battery manufacturing arm of Korean conglomerate SK and the world’s 4th largest battery manufacturer. SK Innovations, however, signed a joint development agreement with Solid Power in October whereby Solid Power will help SK Innovation develop solid state batteries for the Asian market. SK will invest $30 million into Solid Power as well as paying them a licensing fee on all their batteries and they expect this joint venture to cut their solid state battery launch window by 2 years.

SK saw the writing on the wall, that Solid Power is way ahead of the pack and if they want to stay competitive they needed to get access to their R&D.

SK is investing $2.6B in a battery factory in Georgia to build NCM batteries for the initial run of Ford F-150 pickup trucks but you can bet this factory will be designed so that it can easily swap to manufacturing Solid Power’s solid state batteries as soon as they are ready to go to market. Solid Power gets a fat royalty on every battery sold while SK fronts all the capital. I think this is an excellent business strategy by Solid Power versus Qunatumscape trying to do everything themselves. (Source: [https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/](https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/))

The final major competitors in this space are LG Energy Solutions and Samsung SDI Co., but without access to Solid State’s technology they are not expected to have commercial solid state batteries available on the market until 2027-2030. 

**What is the Bear Case?**

I am obviously bullish on this company but no investment is without risks. While Solid Power has so far met all its milestones they are still a year out from initial production and 2 years from large scale commercial deliveries. As with any pre-revenue play these timelines could slip and everything could get pushed farther out leaving you to hold this for longer than you may have hoped for. They may also have issues like many manufacturers do (\*cough Tesla\*) ramping up production as fast as they hope.

**Position and Disclaimers:**

I have an economic interest in the success of Solid Power. I am currently long 12,000 commons and 20,000 warrants.

**TL;DR: Solid Power has amazing potential with solid partners and tech. PT $30 low case, $81 midcase, $120 high case**

12790,Chewy ($CHWY) DD and 50k put YOLO,rcjhgz,"Another day, another earnings report. Today we look at Chewy, an ecommerce retailer of pet food, toys, and budding insurance/veterinary service provider. 3 months ago I wrote a DD about their last earnings. Today we deal with their Q3 earnings report, covering August – October 2021. Last quarter, they guided for USD 2.20-2.22 bn in revenue (23-25% yearly growth, 2.3% quarterly growth) and USD 8.9-9.0 in annual revenue (implying Q4 guidance of USD 2.44bn at the midpoints).

After they reiterated annual guidance on the last call despite disappointing customer numbers, I think there is a good chance that they will fall short this time and have to slightly cut Q4 and annual guidance.

Chewy is a high-flying Covid stock that is down almost exactly 50% from its all time high. Some level of deceleration is clearly priced in, which is a risk for this play. However I believe their earnings report might disappoint for a couple of reasons.

**App downloads and customer numbers**

The biggest and most obvious problem Chewy is facing is their newly added customers. Last quarters additions of 300k fell well short of expectation. Chewy is currently facing a cliff, as they added more customers than ever all throughout 2020. Their comp for this quarter is 1.2 million, slightly less than the 1.6 million they compared to last quarter, but still a very impressive number. As many customers churn around the 1-year mark, they might have problems adding enough gross customers to offset their churn.

&#x200B;

One indication for this is the decline in their app rankings, both on iOS and Android. Apps are commonly (not always) downloaded by NEW customers, so they are a decent proxy for new customer additions. For both platforms, rankings are much lower than they have been since early 2019. There is a particularly pronounced drop on Android, starting around August 1 this year and extending until the current day (even though there was a small recovery). Android is a comparatively important platform for Chewy: while iOS is more popular overall in the USA, Chewy has an approximately equal number of downloads between the two platforms.

Note: Android chart shows overall ranking, iOS chart shows ranking in the Shopping category

**Google Trends**

Google search trends for Chewy also aren’t looking too positive. I’m comparing them here to Peloton, and showing how much each week’s search index dropped compared to the same week last year. Chewy was relatively strong during the summer (a time when Peloton was naturally weak), but has softened a lot going into fall and winter, and is about 20% below last year’s search volume.

[Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/5s4w9bz77j481.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f3dfd7a3520d3abbc2bdc337c3c97456c4e89b)

**Pet adoption trend ending**

Adopting pets was a huge trend when the covid pandemic started last year. Some covid trends are sustainable, others are not. Unsurprisingly, Chewy falls into the latter category: if you already adopted a dog or cat last year, as adorable as they are, you’re probably not rushing out to get the next one immediately. Demand was pulled forward, but not extended. Google search trends for “dog adoption” and “cat adoption” (and other related terms, not shown here) are weak and in fact lower than they have ever been in the past 5 years (to be precise, searches for these terms are at their lowest since 2010).

&#x200B;

[Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/ww75mekrpj481.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=be25c8bb7312e0228ac367866f051aa4a047d6b3)

Website visits to the biggest USA-wide pet adoption sites are also down significantly in the past months. While some seasonal difference is to be expected going into the winter (in a regular year, adoptions peak in July/August and drop by about 10% by November/December), the decline in search traffic this year is more pronounced than that.

**Website visits**

The one counterpoint to the above is website visits to Chewy, which are looking solid if not spectacular. As expected there is a solid uptick in November as people prepare to buy their pets Christmas gifts. While Chewy is ahead in the ecommerce game of their main competitors Petco and Petsmart, their share of website visits has actually remained extremely stable since February this year. I think this is actually a somewhat negative sign for Chewy, as they are valued much higher than competitors since they were supposed to take business away from traditional retailers. To me this chart implies that competitors are catching on and Chewy isn’t taking as much business as they used to.

https://preview.redd.it/mwetzj1f7j481.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9dfa8d1bde97446ee19a6bdf48b6e3672044d3

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In the last week of November, all three websites saw significant upticks in their website views, which is a bit hard to see precisely in the chart above. As a full disclosure, visits to Chewy jumped 36% compared to the previous week. Visits to Petco increased 30%, Petsmart increased by 31%.

**Positions**

Puts at strike 60, expiring this week. I also own additional puts expiring next week.

**Summary**

Chewy stock has been punished quite a lot already but I think there’s a bit more room to drop. Management was pretty upbeat on the last call, which could lead to disappointment among analysts if numbers suddenly look worse this quarter (as I expect they will).

On the other hand, there are 1-2 bright spots in Chewy’s numbers – website views look solid, they have done very well at converting people to Autoship, and their ARPU is rising steadily and extremely impressive. All this may contribute to a positive earnings report. The stock has also bounced off the USD 60 mark quite a lot (even going back to last year), so there’s a risk it doesn’t drop too much if numbers are somewhat satisfying. IV is also relatively high around 7-8%. As always, enter at your own risk.",1639062140.0

12853,Dropbox (DBX): An Undervalued Cloud Company [Bullish Analysis],rchr50,"One of the most overlooked stocks on the American stock market is Dropbox. I personally love it. It's got a lot of potential and the recent drop in price opens up an excellent opportunity for new investors.

# Dropbox at a glance

So, why should we care about Dropbox? Simple. It's a well-performing business that keeps beating analyst expectations. In fact, Dropbox does not have a single earnings or revenue expectations miss since they floated on the stock market! Yes, Dropbox's growth may be slowing down a tiny, tiny bit, but it is still double digits. This growth is likely led by the overwhelming switch since last year to working from home. A lot of people are also starting their own small businesses and they need solutions like Dropbox to help them organise their files, documents and so on. So, the question is, what does Dropbox actually do? Their flagship product, Dropbox, is a cloud storage solution similar to Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud and so on. Essentially, you can store files on Dropbox and synchronise and share them across PC, mobile, tablets and so on. However, Dropbox is actively striving to become a workspace platform or a smart workplace. Over the last three years they have also acquired HelloSign and DocSend that provide even more capabilities to its users. HelloSign provides the ability to send, receive and manage legally binding electronic signatures, whereas DocSend allows you to securely share documents with other people or businesses, track their usage, provide NDAs, meaning Non-Disclosure Agreements, eSignatures, watermarking and so on. Overall, these three services provide the backbone of the Dropbox product offering. However, Dropbox continues to look for new ways to improve and expand and have recently introduced three new features: Capture, Replay and Shop. I am really interested in the Shop feature, I think that has a lot of potential, but it's still too early to tell. If it goes well though, it could become a very successful marketplace for digital content.

# Earnings, revenue and key metrics

This all sounds really good, but let's look at the numbers. Always look at the numbers before you invest ***especially*** these days when there are so many companies that talk a lot, but have nothing to show for it. Like a lot of modern tech companies, the Dropbox business model revolves around subscriptions and that means it is relatively predictable. As long as users are satisfied with the product, they will continue using and paying for it. In Q3 of 2021, Dropbox had over 700 million registered users with 16.49 million paying users up from 15.25 million last year and those include both individuals and business subscriptions. Dropbox's business model focuses on converting existing users into paying users and we can see it's obviously working from this increase of 8.1% in the number of paying users per year. What Dropbox also does is upsell to existing users and nudge them to upgrade to premium plans, purchase additional licences and so on. As they say though, the proof is in the pudding. Over the last year, Dropbox has managed to increase the average revenue per user to $133.79 compared to $128.03 last year, which is a steady increase of 4.5%. When combined with the increase in paying users, that results in an increasingly profitable business and, as a result, Dropbox shows consistent growth every single quarter. Dropbox had 9 consecutive quarters of rising earnings, but broke their streak in the latest one. Q3 of 2021 showed a tiiiny dip from $0.40 to $0.37 dollars EPS, but that is still up 42% since last year. On the flipside, their revenue has grown every single consecutive quarter since they floated on the market with an average revenue growth of 12.5% to 19% year-on-year. Dropbox's revenue for Q3 was $550.2 million compared to $487 million last year so an increase of 12.9%. We can also see a decent increase in Dropbox's free cash flow of 18.4% to $221.5 million in Q3 of 2021.

# Expectations

Going forward, analysts expect that Dropbox will see a 9.8% increase in revenue next year and a 6% increase in earnings. This doesn't sound like much, but it follows after one of Dropbox's best years so far. Plus, analysts keep pushing their expectations up, which, again, means that Dropbox is performing better than expected. That's important because that's what drives the share price up! There have been 7 Q4 earnings revisions in the last 90 days and all 7 of them have been upward revisions. There has also been 9 revenue revision for Dropbox's full-year 2021 revenue in the last 90 days, 8 of which have been upward revisions. Overall, this bodes well for Dropbox's performance.

# Leaner operations

Also, I've noticed something which a lot of investors and analysts are overlooking right now, but it is extremely, extremely important in my opinion. The operating expenses of Dropbox have barely moved since December 2019 while their revenue has grown by 26% and their free cash flow has increased by 80%. Lean operations are what good tech businesses are all about so this is a really, really big plus for Dropbox in my books. Dropbox has high gross margins, currently 81% compared to the 80% last year and improving operating margins with 29.3% right now versus 23.0% last year.

# Founder is still in business

Another bullish argument for Dropbox is the fact that the founder Andrew Houston still owns almost 30% of Dropbox. That's a massive stake and shows his commitment to the company even though he did sell 9% of his total shares on 17th Nov. That's his only sale in the last 2 years though. Founders having a big stake in the company usually means that the company is still in the growth stage and the share price still has room to grow.

# Financial position

Then, let's take a look at Dropbox's cash position. They are flush with cash, absolutely loaded! They currently have $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents which is more than their debt of $1.37 billion which means that Dropbox is in a really good financial position considering that they are also profitable. Plus, Dropbox is not actually paying any interest on its long-term debt! The reason why is because they raised money using convertible notes without any interest. Instead, those notes give the loaner the opportunity to convert the notes to shares of Dropbox at the price of $35.35 and $38.25 per share. So, what is Dropbox doing with its cash? Well, first of all, they have been buying back shares. In fact, Dropbox has managed to reduce shares outstanding by 8.6% since the start of 2020. Just during the last quarter, they've bought back $181 million worth of shares! Second, they're using that cash to acquire new companies to fuel additional growth. Acquisitions can be a double-edged sword sometimes, but Dropbox has made it work so far. As I mentioned before, Dropbox bought HelloSign in February 2019 and DocSend in March 2021. The two acquisitions boosted Dropbox's capabilities and now allow them to offer a complete, full suite of self-serve products to its users.

Alright, I hope that by now we all have a pretty good understanding of what is the current situation with Dropbox. Two main questions now remain. One, is Dropbox trading at a good price. Two, what do we need to watch with Dropbox?

# Valuation

Let's look at the valuation first. Currently, Dropbox trades for a PE of 17.6 calculated using the adjusted EPS compared to the sector median of 25.3. Dropbox's forward PE is 16.5 which again lower than the sector median of 24.96. Finally, its PEG ratio is 0.53 and anything under 1 means that the stock is undervalued. The price-to-sales ratio of Dropbox is 4.66 compared to the sector's 4.08 and their forward price-to-sales are 4.36 compared to 4.14 so that's slightly higher than the median, but not by much. Dropbox also said that they expect $1 billion dollars in free cash flow by 2024, which gives us a forward price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 9 which is really, really good. Overall, Dropbox looks undervalued by several indicators right now. In terms of valuation, SimplyWallstreed gives Dropbox a fair value of $53.5 dollars based on its free cash flow. My personal EPS valuation of Dropbox gives me a more conservative figure of $40.2 dollars. Finbox's 10-year Gordon Growth model gives Dropbox an average valuation of $35.4 dollars which is near the analyst consensus of $34.5. Obviously, these are not precise targets, but the main point is that Dropbox currently appears really undervalued gives its current price of $24.7 dollars. The price of Dropbox surprisingly dipped 20% over the last 5 weeks which was strange. There was no actual obvious reason for it as Dropbox reported strong results and actually raised guidance going forward. To me, that's just a great opportunity to get a great stock at a discount!

# What to watch with Dropbox

Before we finish this off, I want to mention a few things that we need to keep an eye on with Dropbox. First of all, we need to monitor the number of paying users and the average revenue per user as we need to see steady increases there for Dropbox to justify the investment. If those numbers start to stagnate, it may be time to get out of Dropbox. Another figure to watch is the stock-based compensation. In 2020, the total stock-based compensation was $505.9 million which was more than the adjusted earnings of $409.1 million for the entire year! Dropbox is obviously no longer a startup, but it is still in a growth stage so that type of stock-based compensation is normal, but it's still good to keep an eye on it as it dilutes stock ownership. A lot of people have missed the fact that Dropbox has stock-compensation clauses for its CEO, Andrew Houston, connected to its stock price. More precisely, those stock prices are $30, $35, $40, basically on every $5 dollar increment so the more Dropbox's price goes up, the more stock-based compensation Andrew Houston will get. Finally, it looks like institutions are bullish on DBX, but a bit less so than before. The current put-to-call ratio is only 0.8 and that's up from 0.42 during the previous quarter. Essentially, a put-to-call ratio below 1 means that funds think Dropbox will go up. If that ratio goes significantly above 1, then that's one sign of bearish sentiment on the side of funds. Also, it looks like the institutional ownership of Dropbox has gone done from 84% in the last quarter to 76.6% right now. Personally, I think that's because Dropbox hit an all-time high in the latest quarter and funds took the opportunity to take some profits so I'm not that worried about the reducing ownership.

So, that's all I have to say about Dropbox for now. What do you think? Are you bullish like me?",1639056762.0

12866,PayPal: Outlook Constructive amid the recent pullback,rchfbr,"**Call to Action:** We see no significant risks to PYPL’s position in the short term and view the 2022 setup favorably. Price target $250. 

**Thesis:** PYPL’s performance will continue into 2022; while facing covid-comps, the combination of organic growth and elimination of drags will bode well for sustained double-digit growth. PYPL’s 2022 Venmo deal with Amazon will sustain growth in transaction volume while also boosting Venmo’s own growth. Continued payments and eCommerce integration affirm confidence after 3Q comps and a softer 4Q guidance.

**Expanded Payments:** PYPL noted that Buy Now, Pay Later TPV run rate exceeds $8B annually, and new initiatives and expansions. BNPL is expanding to Spain and Italy, and consumer late fees will be eliminated since October 1st. PYPL continues to expand across payment verticals, with payment solutions with Walmart, Booking.com, AliExpress, etc. PYPL further noted that customers will be able to make purchases on AMZN and mobile shopping app via Venmo after 2022. 

**PayPal Wallet:** PYPL highlighted the global rollout of the digital wallet, and noted early wins in user engagement, driving increased transactions. PYPL Cash Card enrollments increased 35%, first-time alternative-currency users have increased 15%, and first-time donations have increased 35%. 

**M&A:** PYPL highlighted the tuck-in acquisition of Paidy, the leading two-sided payments platform and BNPL provider in Japan, which closed on Oct. 13th. This positions well for the 3rd largest eCommerce market’s pivot towards cashless payments. 

**Guidance:** PYPL’s guidance baked-in headwinds from reopening and cited EBAY as a continued drag on performance. Management currently expects around 18% revenue growth for 2022, with a reacceleration of revenues in 2H22 following a flatter 1H. Overall, management expects above medium-term guidance. 

**Key Takeaways:** PYPL’s initiatives continue to boost organic growth in transaction volume and user engagement. With the expiration of the PYPL-eBay deal, performance drag will be reduced. However, in the short term, tough prior-year comps and project maturation both point toward a flatter 1H22. The long-term setup is more positive with secular growth in cashless payments. 

**Estimates and Valuation:** My price target of $250 is using a forecasted 2026 Diluted Non-GAAP EPS, with a terminal EPS multiple of 26, a discount rate of 9%. This means the stock currently trades at 13.14x times Terminal EPS. 

***Downside Risks:*** increased credit losses from the BNPL segment, accelerated take-rate reductions, slowdown in transaction volume growth from normalization, poor choice of acquisitions. 

***Upside Risks***: outperformance in transaction volume and revenue growth, Acceleration in Venmo and cashless transaction uptake, any slowdown in take-rate reductions, positive consumer behavior changes.

Welcome to the world of leverage!

While researching for my last article, I came across this [interesting survey](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) that highlighted the increasing use of leverage by retail investors. The key part that stood out was

>40% of investors said they have taken on debt to invest, including 80% of Gen Zers, 60% of millennials, 28% of Gen Xers.

80% of Gen-Z borrowing money to invest seems to be very high. And it's not like they are taking inconsequential amounts.

>Of those who took on debt to invest, nearly half (46%) borrowed $5,000 or more.

While I am not questioning the outcomes from their survey \[1\], I ran a similar survey with drastically different results. As you can see below, only around 13% of the responders have used borrowed funds while investing in the market \[2\]

https://preview.redd.it/ycobp07y7g481.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0a47ed7defa9985cfeac235753e1176d0cdf4d4

No matter the variations in the results, the key insight is that a large number of retail investors are using leverage while investing. So in this week’s analysis, let’s do a deep dive into the world of leverage.

**Leverage - A double-edged sword!**

>Having a large amount of leverage is like driving a car with a dagger on the steering wheel pointed at your heart. If you do that, you will be a better driver. There will be fewer accidents but when they happen, they will be fatal - Warren Buffet

For those unfamiliar with the concept, investing with leverage is very simple.

Let’s say that you had $10K in your brokerage account. You have a high conviction stock that you think is going to have a very good return in the next year and want to invest more than $10K in the said equity. You can take another $10K as a loan from your brokerage staking your entire position as collateral.

Assume the stock went up 10% over the next month and you exit the position.

This is the magic of leverage. You used a 2:1 leverage on your investment and doubled your return. (It won’t exactly be double as you have to pay some amount as interest for the money lent to you. I have ignored it for ease of understanding)

Why leverage is known as a double-edged sword is because of what happens when the stock price tanks. Let’s assume that the stock went down 10% and you had to exit the position.

The 2:1 leverage would literally double your losses \[3\] since your exposure to the stock was double that of your initial available capital.

Now that we know what the benefits and risks associated with using leverage are, let’s look at the current trends in the market.

**Rise of leverage in retail trading**

Trading on margin is just one way of using leverage while investing. While there are more exciting ways to lose money using leverage (Options, Futures trading, etc.), in this article we would be focusing only on leveraging using borrowed money.

The below [study from BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2103v.htm) shows an ever-increasing demand for leverage from retail investors since 2019. By Dec’20 the total amount of debt stood at $750 Billion, the highest level on record since 1997 (Inflation adjusted). Adding to this, retail investors are using options now more than ever before. A study by Goldman Sachs showed that retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***.

https://preview.redd.it/68v48r848g481.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=281bf0692d3ffe39a7081257278f1ae36b98a4ca

The pandemic has only accelerated this trend as showcased by the Harris Poll. 46% of the responders stated that they have either bought options or bought on margin since the pandemic has started.

https://preview.redd.it/yk8n56758g481.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6a5e15121fd74c15f4c971ab03aae396d3aa9f

It’s not that using leverage is inherently risky. The way many of them are obtaining leverage is a cause for concern. The below chart shows the source of funds used by investors for using leverage.

While borrowing from friends and family can be considered interest-free (it does come with its own set of issues), on average, [personal loans charge 9% to 13%](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-loans/average-personal-loan-interest-rates) APR and credit card debt on average charges a whopping [15% to 23% in APR.](https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/average-apr)

https://preview.redd.it/6c4lkm468g481.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bf61ba2d0cf94a730b34c228d03bbf2489d9e1

The issue here is that just to break even on the investment, the stock or the portfolio must go up somewhere between 9% - 23%! Imagine picking the right stock with it going up by 20% only to lose money in the end because you used the wrong leverage.

**How to use leverage correctly?**

>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes

Leverage used correctly can be a powerful tool in growing your portfolio. As per a [study published by APR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative-Thinking/Why-Do-Most-Investors-Choose-Concentration-Over-Leverage), more investors prefer concentration over leverage while thinking of maximizing their expected return.

What this means in plain English is that most of us will just allocate larger and larger portions of our portfolios to stocks expecting a better return, whereas ideally, you would have got a better risk-adjusted return if you had a well-diversified portfolio and then leveraged that \[4\].

https://preview.redd.it/klhzo1w88g481.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dc4189963ba9160bf775114c14287c65ffd84f5

Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff (both professors at Yale) argued [in a 2008 paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) that it’s responsible for young investors to use leverage. The argument made is that when we are young we need to maintain a lot of exposure to stocks but we would be cash poor. The solution is to use margin to invest in equity and gradually decrease the percentage of leverage as you become older. This in the end would end up providing a much better-expected return.[5](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/leverage#footnote-5)

But using traditional leverage while investing comes with its own risk

1. **Limited access to cheap debt:** Not everyone might be eligible for getting a loan that’s cheap enough to make sense for leverage investing. Depending on your current assets/credit score, the loan you get might be sustainably more or less expensive than the next guy!
2. **Margin call:** If you are using a margin account from your brokerage and are unable to maintain the margin requirements set by your broker (i.e, value of the margin account falls below the required amount), unless you have enough cash to cover the position, the brokers will liquidate your position themselves and cover their loan.
3. **Risk of loss greater than initial investment amount:** In our first example, we only considered what happens when there is a 10% loss. Imagine a scenario where the company you invested in files for bankruptcy. Then you would lose the 10K investment you made and still owe another 10K to your broker making it a 200% loss on your investment.

Given all these complexities, how would a normal retail investor realistically use leverage?

**Leveraged ETFs**

Leveraged ETFs take care of all the complicated stuff for you. It’s like investing in any other ETF (albeit, with a slightly higher expense ratio) where they use debt and derivatives to amplify the return of the underlying index.

A classic example is [ProShares Ultra S&P500](https://www.proshares.com/funds/sso.html) (SPXU), where it tries to 2x the return of its underlying benchmark (in this case S&P 500) everyday.

As you can see from the below chart, the returns are magnified when compared to the normal S&P-500. Another example is TQQQ which (3x leverage of Nasdaq) has generated 57.86% CAGR over the last 10 years compared to the 22.67% CAGR of QQQ.

https://preview.redd.it/syh7ytja8g481.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=461e2e1c35c5850b993f7b01d2669e6dbc037a75

While leveraged ETFs present a rosy picture in returns, they do come with significant risks. The single most important issue with leveraged ETF is that it breaks the number one rule of Warren Buffet - Never lose money.

Leveraged ETFs work amazingly well when it’s a bull market. But imagine a hypothetical scenario where the market drops 20% in one day. The 3x leveraged ETF (since it has to close its position every day) suffers a 60% drop. Now the market has to only go up 25% for the regular investor to break even on their index fund. But for someone who had invested in a 3x leveraged ETF, the market has to go up 50% for their fund to even break even. In an outlier scenario where the market drops more than 33%, you will suffer a 100% loss \[6\] in which case it’s game over.

**Conclusion**

Leverage is that magical thing that works until it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, it does not look pretty. [Ask Bill Hwang](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days) if you don’t believe me! He had an amazing run where he converted 200MM into $20 Billion in 10 years (which is phenomenal considering the scale he was working with), then lost all of it in **just two days** due to an extremely over-leveraged position.

Granted, the optimal use of leverage while investing would end up giving you outsized returns, but the extremely complicated nature by which you have to rebalance and carefully adjust your portfolio is far beyond the skill-set of most investors. You don’t have to take it from me, take it from two of the most successful investors of our time.

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The survey was conducted by Qualtrics. it was an online survey of 2,046 U.S. consumers — of which 994 were investors — from March 30 to April 6, 2021. The survey was administered using a non-probability-based sample, and quotas were used to ensure the sample base represented the overall population. All responses were reviewed by researchers for quality control.

\[2\] Either the sample from which they did the analysis was biased or the Reddit crowd is extremely risk-averse, both of which seem to be not realistic. Let me know what you think about why the results are so vastly different!

\[3\] Same as with the gain calculations, in reality, your losses would be even higher as you would have to pay back the interest as well on the borrowed amount.

\[4\] This has more to do with the perception of risk. While concentrating all your portfolio into equity when you are young does not feel that risky (due to a longer timeframe), ideally, your risk would have been lower if you had borrowed money to invest in a well-diversified portfolio. But this intuitively feels riskier (borrowing money) for a large segment of investors even though mathematically it would give a better return over the long run.

\[5\] The argument made in the paper supporting leverage is that even if we end up blowing the account due to leverage, the capital loss would be lower as we would be young and we would have enough time to build up another account. [This excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k&ab_channel=BenFelix) from Ben Felix explains the concepts in detail.

\[6\] Leveraged ETFs are so complex that they can be an analysis topic of their own. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoYVmlOxwbA&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) from Plain Bagel does a great job of explaining the risks associated with leveraged ETFs.",1639052835.0

TLRY share was at near 20% when they merged with APHA 8mo ago and now they're under 10%.  It took them a scant 8mo to drop 50% share.  No wonder they're pivoting to alcohol with the recent acquisition of Breckenridge distillery to run alongside their prior acquisition of Sweetwater

CGC was up to 16% share and pole position a few years back with a 5b investment from STZ and now under 8% and 3rd place. 

ACB was at 12% at one point and now below 3% share in Canada. 3%?! Behind Decibel who no one has ever heard of!?

These companies blew through billions in failed M&A enriching the execs with shady deals along the way. To be fair, most of those execs have since moved on...

However the new execs don't appear to be doing much better: to wit, CEOs Klein from CGC got like 40m in comp and Simon from TLRY got like 30m comp in the last round.

It's over 14% by the same method used then, and coincidentally, US inflation peaked around 15% back in 1980.

More interesting, the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, hitting 20% interest before finally getting things under control.

Imagine your margin account, average interest on margin is like 8% and we are at the lowest interest rates in approximately the last 4,000 years. All markets seek a mean, so it seems reasonable that an era of floods of easy money and the lowest interest rates in human history could be followed by increasing scarcity of money and high rates.  Maybe very rapid, high inflation will be the catalyst that leads to that?

Not sure how the fed can fight inflation this time, even raising rates to 5% seems like it would mean the collapse of everything.  20% seems unimaginable.",1639029290.0

The same bullish $BB bullshit gets posted 2+ times a week where random internet idiots praise $BB for being the future and every week nothing happens. Every earnings none of the tidbits from the numerous PR blasts are materializing into revenue. Everyone is pro $BB ($BBagholding) and I need you guys to turn against it so I can be inverse of WSB and actually make money for once.

Blah Blah Blah the Patent Sale. Blackberry's last reported cash on hand was $700 million. Rumored to be in the billions, the patent sale will make Blackberry flush with cash. Last earnings call, an analyst asked what they would do if they had a lot of cash. Johnny C basically said they would invest in cyber security and step on the gas aka you'll not see any fruits of that cash from the patent sale for a bazillion years. Cylance, a fumbled M&A, is in the dust compared to other AI security providers and doubtful they'll be able to catch up, even with billions of dollars in investments.

Johnny C was CEO of Sybase for a while and it took 12 years for him to turn that business from a dumpster fire into a M&A dumpster fire for SAP.

Johnny C has been CEO of Blackberry for 7 years now; we have a ways to go before this company takes off.

They do not own nor lease the properties, they are instead an automation platform that uses Machine Learning and AI to generate the maximum yield for their customers (rental property owners).

On average, a rental property owner is able to increase the rental yield on their property by an additional 30% , after taking into account fee's and commisions charged by Vacasa. Property Managers are able to increase yield's by 10% by using Vacasa.

https://preview.redd.it/os2vfuy2cf481.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=50bc2415348fed517c45ad7ba9034f9f1dfc60ad

Although Vacasa has its own booking platform,which generates 30% of their revenues, this is a platform agnostic company. listing's are presented on all booking platforms (AirBnb, VRBO, [Booking.com](https://booking.com/),etc) with platform fee's charged ontop of the daily rental rate therefore the listing fee, payment processing fee and cleaning fee do not come from Vacasa's take-rate or commission.

Recently management raised guidance for 2021 and 2022 due to the strong demand for travel and travel related services within the US. This is a real company with with real revenues of 800M for 2021 and positive EBITDA and 56% CAGR.

Vacasa does not operate outside the US, therefore isnt succeptible to the risk of lockdowns in Europe or Asia affecting their growth / guidance forcast's.

**(Relatively) low public float post close. 88% Insiders rolling over, 200m PIPE. No Warrants**

This is a company that grows through acquisitions. Management has indicated its faster to acquire a property manager in a new market than it is to start fresh. Post merger, they will be cashed up, ready to grow.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uku42eo9cf481.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=5073ccc44c087e6884565c9921327770fe0948fa

For reference, the TAM is 5M rental properties within the USA, of which Vacasa currently has less than 1% (30K Rentals). Eventually, once the rest of the world recover's from COVID, International expansion could be a driver of growth as well.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/828pwxfgcf481.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=761b60d17250ec1df332db26d5846332f9fa897c

Finally, to be clear. Vacasa does not own nor lease properties themselves limiting their exposure to another COVID esque event burning through their cash reserves. Vacasa takes a cut of the profits during boom times and hold minimal risk during the bust times. As they are a platform agnostic , there is limited exposure of Airbnb ,VRBO etc coming out with similar services to compete.

This type of product works well for folk's who have a second home but dont have the time to actively manage it. They simply offer the home to Vacasa who manage the rental property and undertake general maintenance (Gardening / PLumbing,etc), as required

13150,IONQ,rc4z1j,"Real DD from the first 2 days of the Q2B conference in Santa Clara, summarized by me:

Head of Air Force Research Labs quantum tech says US, UK, Canada, NZ, and Australia are collaborating on quantum applications for unaided navigation, encryption, communication and sensors/ML. A joint field test will be conducted this summer. The small size of IONQ's processors and lack of need for cooling (done by lasers), they believe, will allow them to be mounted inside aircraft. Some testing of this is underway already. AF believes trapped ions are the superior QC method and there is ""much more to come.""

Dell collaboration is moving past the test phase, but specifics were kept under lock and key.

MIT's Center For Quantum Computing believes there will be many winners, depending on the usage needs for each system, but IONQ's small form (ie the QPU can be held in the palm of your hand vs you being able to walk inside it) and the ability to operate at room temperature continue to be significant practical advantages for scaling. IONQ has confirmed they are on track for a rack mounted system. 

Using trapped Barium-133 ions appears superior to Ytterbium. It is rumored that is what IONQ has now been using. 

Mark Solomon, who worked in quantum computing sales at IBM before joining IONQ, said unequivocally when asked that he ""left [IBM] because IONQ's tech was far superior on every front."" 

Confirmed QCWare did derivative calculations for Goldman Sachs on IONQ systems. 

Staff plans to have 200 employees by the end of 2022. It currently stands at 100, up from 60 last year. 



Here is a synopsis of day 2 of Q2B. Despite the stock price, it was a VERY significant one for IONQ. Once again, I do not take credit for the information provided here, just compiling it and few thoughts of my own. The credit goes to those on the ground reporting it live.

The QC industry stands at $490 million, but is growing 3x faster than the classical computing industry. It appears most in the industry agree the point of critical inflection is 2-3 years away. This is in line with my personal research into the industry and is important because a year ago the most optimistic estimates had it 5, 10, or even 20 years away. There is zero doubt at this time that IONQ leads the pack. Everyone else is trying (and might) catch up.

The Air Force presentation yesterday foreshadowed todays announcement using Barium-133 in the next generation of QCs. This allows for 99.98% gate fidelity BEFORE error correction. That alone should blow your mind if you understand this stuff. If not, they are also able to use cheap and easily sourced visual lasers to control individual atoms through SOFTWARE. This speaks to the new level of precision. In addition to this, they are working on 3 more generations of QCs. That is to say the Barium computer is not a plan or theoretical - it's being used. There are 3 additional ones already being worked on. When the 3rd generation comes out, it is nearly impossible to believe they won't have 70+ algorithmic qubits, which is generally held as the standard for true quantum supremacy.

The Barium laser software controlled QC is likely why not only Dell chose to work with IONQ, but also the US, UK, NZ, Canada, and Australian militaries.

In private, both Peter Chapman and Mark Solomon agreed that this will be the technology that is able to scale up, be modular, and overtake classical computing forever on complex calculations. 

2-3 years, possibly sooner, we will be headed towards the dawn of a fundamentally new era not only in the company, but human history. The stock price will eventually catch up, but this is difficult stuff for experts, let alone Main Street, to grasp. It will happen though, and much sooner than people used to think.",1639009326.0
13151,LULULEMON EARINGS 12/09/2021 AH - Supply Chain vs Becky and Chad,rc4y46," 

I used to write earnings DD back in 2019-2020, Gonna start again. 

**TLDR - Long at 380$, probably will beat earnings, god know if they'll raise guidance. I expect 450 but I am also retarded.** 

**Ticker -  Lulu Lemon (LULU)**

**Price - 426.00**

**Earnings - 12/09/2021 AH**

**Category - New Retail** 

**Macro - Mixed, Logistics vs Sentiments**

**Macro + Fundamental**

Lululemon is an athleisure brand that focuses on high quality sports and lifewear for both men and women. LULU as a brand has grown considerably throughout the pandemic and beyond, currently repping a very high 58x sales ratio. Expensive as it may be, LULU has beaten cleanly the last 5 quarters, all the more impressive due to the pandemic. With plans to expand internationally, LULU’s potential as a leading global retailer is another growth driver. Currently, only 35% of LULU’s total revenue comes from outside of the US and Canada, with less than 100 stores in China. The addressable market for LULU is huge. However, **the main concern with earnings is the guidance moving forward due to supply chain bottlenecks and additional covid concerns. Fundamentally speaking, LULU is firing on all cylinders and is a favorite of the retail sector. It is also one of the most expensive.** 

**Technical**

PC ratio volume is at 1.37 and PC ratio OI is about 1.26 both of which are bearish. RSI is about 39, nearing oversold. Implied movement about 8% or about 33$. Short interest is 1.5% of float, with 2 days to cover, not a lot. Support at 200 day EMA on the daily, with 3 separate bounces at around the 390 range. and resistance is at about 458, which is the quarterly lvl2 fib extension (1.618). Options markets say bearings, though the past few days were red, as we went below the 450 near term support and bounced off the 414 bottom, which is a negative lvl 3 fib (2.618). 

**Sentimental**

LULU is a favorite of both institutional investors and insiders with massive buying happening in October. In addition, retail investors love LULU due to the proliferation of the product and investor base - LULU investors typically wear LULU. Analyst price target ranges between 570 and 410, with the average being 488$. LULU has had a shift towards digital commerce integrated with their stores due to the pandemic and web traffic is hitting a season upside. Given LULU’s product price points, I believe demand has not lessened and in-fact grown due to the popularity and shift in stay-at-home lifewear. However, if LULU misses either on the earnings results, with revenue being the major concern, or provides weak guidance, we may see a significant return to realistic valuations. You can draw Peleton comparisons, but I don't think they even in the same ballpark given LULU's product quality and growing international strength. The lawsuit recently is probably going to be nothing. 

**Personally, I'd rather long LULU than short it.**

**I’d sell the 390 12/10 puts (3.95), and buy a call debit spread 12/17 440/450 for 3.35$ net 0.60$. Unlimited loss on downside though, if LULU just craters, but I don’t see it under 380$ unless something really bad happens.**

All these delays means Little Timmy and his friends won't be getting their normal Christmas presents from Santa this year. Yes, even Santa who can ride his sleigh around the world in one night is being affected by this bullshit. Instead of getting a new Xbox to play Fortnite and Minecraft on or a new $1200 iPhone, Timmy is getting a big fat lump of coal for Christmas. He also failed all of his Zoom classes this year for not paying attention, so he deserves it anyway. This made me think - who is a major producer of coal that would benefit from this? Why, VALE of course.

That's right, Timmy will be getting his coal straight out of the Brazilian jungle to burn in his family's fire place. Finally the little shit is useful for something. Anyways, VALE is one of the largest miners of coal and iron in the world. Other than that, I dont really know much about them. I heard they are a well run company from someone in the daily thread so ill just run with that. Plus Brazil is a cool country and isn't China, so that's good.

* I got a chance an up close and personal view of the Fisker Ocean at the recent LA auto show. It will be an absolute game changer in the industry and will drive sales much higher than street expectations 
* My updated model suggests Fisker could we worth $167/share by YE 2023, $559/share by YE 2024 and over $900/share by YE 2025 
* Board members had been buying stock in the last few weeks in meaningful amounts 
* Soros just bought a large stake in Fisker 
* On 11/25/21, the CEO tweeted that after the recent LA auto show, “We r sold out until mid-2023. After reviewing with Magna, I think we can exceed 7,500 production volume (previous 5,000) per month to second ½ of 2023, to for fill increasing demand!”. This implies 25% more production capacity for the full year of 75,000 units vs previous guidance of 60,000.

There have been many great articles on Seeking Alpha about the history of Fisker, what makes Fisker unique (using MAGNA and FOXCONN as contract manufacturers much like NIO has done), and some of the troubled history of the failed Fisker Karma. I will not focus on those details here. Suffice to say that Fisker was one of the early pioneers in the EV race and launched his iconic Fisker Karma BEFORE the Tesla Model S. Yes, he ran into some issues with his battery supplier and yes, his previous company did go belly-up. But America is all about comebacks and I believe Henrik will be coming back stronger than ever. I like the fact that he has failed in the past, because that will just make him hungrier to prove himself and learn from his mistakes.

You will not find any EV with this range, feature set and dynamic style in this price class (please check [www.fiskerinc.com](http://www.fiskerinc.com) for more details and to reserve one with a $250 deposit). It’s a class leading SUV that starts at $37,499 ($29,999 with current federal subsidies - likely to increase).

**“Delivery” of cars is really only 4 months away**

Most people think the company is 1 year or more behind Rivian or Lucid, but that is simply not the case. In the recent earnings call on Nov 3rd, 2021, Henrik Fisker said that “well over eight months before we launch the vehicle” that Fisker will be “building two vehicles a day”. With SOP (Start of Production) slated to be on November 17th, 2022, this implies that they will be building 2 cars/day starting around March 2022.  Assuming approximately 261 days until SOP, that means 522 cars that will be built before the official SOP.

What will Fisker do with these 522 cars? It’s just way too many for crash-testing and homologation. As a point of reference, Lucid said it plans to deliver only 520 cars by the end of 2021 and only 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022. On December 1st 2021, Henrik stated after the auto show “we are well over 20,000 \[reservations\] and the numbers go up every few minutes.” Difference in their respective market cap? How about $6 BN in market cap for Fisker and over $80 BN in market cap for Lucid - 10x as much! Yes, Lucid is delivering 20,000 cars in 2022 vs Fisker delivering (in my model) 75,000 cars in 2023, but is that valuation differential warranted?

Also, Lucid reservations holders have recently been alerted to expect delays and it looks increasingly unlikely that the 520 delivery number for 2021 will actually materialize. Lucid also announced yesterday that it is being investigated by the SEC for its SPAC deal with Churchill Capital. Fisker announced on the same day that ""Our merger with Spartan Energy Corp, completed in October 2020, was reviewed by the SEC and other relevant regulatory authorities, To date, we have not received any requests for additional information from the SEC relating to the merger transaction and, to our knowledge, we are not under any investigation by the SEC regarding our SPAC merger”.

I know where I would rather put my money.  What happens if Fisker delivers some of these pre-production cars to employees or “friendlies” much like Rivian has done? We have to realize that the start of production means different things to different people. Simply because Rivian owns their own plant, their definition of start of production is very different than FSR’s which relies on contract manufacturers. Before you start to complain about Fisker’s lack of owning their own plant, just look at NIO’s $60 BN market cap and it’s run from $2 to $33 to realize that outsourced production can be very successful.

Anyway, let’s get back to Lucid’s recent history to get a sense of what a stock price reaction might look like for FSR when we start seeing some cars on the road. On Oct 27th 2021, Lucid issued a press release stating that customer deliveries of its Lucid Air Dream Edition (priced at $169,000) would start on Oct 30th, 2021. Lucid surged as much as 47% the next and the stock eventually went from $27.69 to $45.92 in 7 trading days! A staggering 65% return in 7 days.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html)

What would happen with Fisker’s stock if it could start “delivering” cars in March 2022, which is less than 4 months away? A similar move in FSR would yield a $18.34 to $30.26 move. What happens when Fisker allows press and auto magazines to start test driving the car and they get blown away with 550bp, 0-60 MPH in less than 3.6 seconds, smart traction (allows the right amount of torque to the correct wheels) and “race-car” like handling?

Fisker also features an innovative flexible leasing model with no long-term contracts. This can generate “more than 250% margin on these vehicles long-term” as Henrik mentioned on the Q3 2021 conference call. FSR can lease their cars over and over again over a 12-year life span and charge each new customer for OTA (over the air) updates for different software enhancements.

**Putting it all together in a model**

So, now that we know Fisker could pop once their cars start rolling off the pre-production line around March 2022, what is the company really worth over the long-term? Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas resumed coverage of Fisker with a $40 PT and a bull case PT of $90 on August 10, 2021.  News has gotten dramatically better since then, and Jonas has yet to appropriately update his model.

We not only had the LA auto show, the news that Fisker was using battery packs from CATL (largest battery supplier in the world) with class leading LFP chemistry, but also critical news that Foxconn signed a definitive agreement to purchase the 6.2 MM square foot Lordstown facility in order to produce the Fisker PEAR. This factory gives Fisker the ability to take advantage of any incremental EV federal credits for producing in the US. Henrik even said in an interview that this means that PEAR production could be moved up earlier. He has also dropped hints that Magna is ahead of schedule for the Ocean.  Please show me ONE EV company that has announced being early to market.

On the February 21th, 2021 conference call an analyst asked “in the announcement from yesterday, you talked about the Foxconn relationship alone to be 250,000?” and Henrik answered “could see surpassing our original goal of 250,000 by 2025.”  Then, on the Q2 call August 6th 2021, Henrik stated that when JUST speaking about the Ocean “I think we will easily be able to sell more than 250,000 vehicles of that a year and just wait to see it. It's just amazing. In terms of the last two vehicles for its total plan of, four coming together between before 2025, we actually already have designed the third vehicle and the fourth vehicle will be already in negotiations for something pretty unique about that vehicle as well. So the four vehicles actually are on plan.”

Taking all this new information, Henrik’s recent tweets, and some factoids from the recent conference calls and running it through a model yields some pretty impressive stock prices. The peer group trades as forward sales multiples of between 14x (Tesla) to 35x (Lucid), so let us use a starting multiple of 14x for Fisker and we get the following resulting stock prices:

**Conclusion** 

* With a 28% short interest ratio, things could get really exciting when we start seeing some Fisker cars in the hands of press in early 2022
* TSLA’s stock was up 743.44% in 2020 and its not that much of a stretch to see Fisker making a similar move in 2022 when we get closer to production 
* Fisker is trading at less that 1/10 the valuation of Lucid and yet will produce more cars than Lucid by 2025",1639001893.0

With the recent market turbulence and the fed finally recognizing inflation is here to stay we are now likely at a moment of reckoning before this switch occurs.

I come to you today with the value play of value plays to take shelter from the turbulence. A beat down, unloved and misunderstood stock that has the added benefit of helping you forget about your meme play losses. I present to you Molson Coors ($**TAP**)

Now before you call me a boomer and tell me to get out for recommending this stock please look at my pretty pictures below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4dp4ybsb0e481.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=07c78924f042ca202754d39176b12e166fd2d87d

TAP hit a peak of \~$111 in 2016 and has ever sense been in a steady decline. Why has this been occurring? In 2016 Coors acquired Miller Brewing merging the two companies creating what we now know as Molson Coors. To finance this acquisition they added on a TON of debt ($12B) to their balance sheet. Following the merger they have suffered marginal declines in year over year sales as consumer sentiment shifts away from big beer beers towards regional brews and seltzers. $TAP failed to respond timely to this shift and has only recently in the last two years been diversifying its product offerings.

Now for the positive news and opportunity. There are two strong headwinds I see for $**TAP** that lead me to believe this could be the perfect value hedge to hide in and during upcoming market turbulence while delivering tendies with your choice of dipping sauce and adult refreshment.

**Future Products**

There have been lots of prior posts on reddit discussing new products and JV's rolled out under TAP's Revitalization plan so I am just going to include the highlights and link to past posts below. The most important thing to understand is a lot of these product where introduced prior to present but, most of them have not experienced full nationwide rollout.

A. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer (JV) Jan 2022 Nationwide rollout:

Joint venture with $KO Cokacola presently only available in 16 target markets (states/cities) across the US. Has received glowing reviews and also has nationwide 4% market share while only being present in 16 markets. I expect this to increase to a 10%+ market share in the coming year

B.Yuengling (JV) Mid 2022 Midwest and West coast roll out, Introduced to Texas in Q3:

That East Coast beer that people love formed an agreement with Coors in 2020 to distribute yuengling to all us states that do not presently have it (currently only in 22 US states)

C. $TAP and HexoCorp (JV) ""Truss"" Canabis Infused Drink:

This one is more of a long term play. Another TAP joint venture this time with HexoCorp. The drink is currently only available in Colorado but is poised to be a cannabis drink market leader once federal legislation allows for nationwide distribution. On going wipers of acquisition of HexoCorp by TAP in the future but nothing material released.

Past Posts by others with more company/product info. Big takeaways is all of these new products will be hitting their stride in the coming year (excluding HexoCorp drink).

**Valuation**

Presently of all the Beer stocks (**TAP**, **BUD**, **STZ**, **SAM**) **TAP** holds the lowest multiple across the industry in Fwd PE, Price To Sales and Price To Book. While you can argue a lower valuation is deserved you cannot argue that the disparity between TAP and the other beverage makers is justified.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gaoqf31e0e481.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d930297f06be2c46656ce604edad243cd828e3

Reminder: one of the main factors driving the decline in TAP stock price was/is debt. However, if you compare the total debt over current market cap of TAP you come up with 74% debt to market cap. Now using this same ratio and comparing to BUD you find that TAP has comparatively less debt 74% vs 89% yet this is incorrectly cited as rational for keeping the stock price down.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nhzbxb2f0e481.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=41276728a1e3858d3620fd8200326a00832113dd

Furthermore $TAP has consistently chipped away at their debt burden even during the pandemic they continued to make payments.

Revenue:

The past two quarters have been absolute knock outs in terms of revenue yet the market hasn't taken notice. Note specifically revenue is 1.75x that of 2016 when the stock price was \~$111.

Whats the take away from all this? TAP does not deserve its current multiple. It has a better balance sheet than its closest industry peer and its multiples should soon reflect that. Their new product channels have started to deliver increased revenue that is poised to explode in the next year. Overlaying the low valuation of this company in context with the current market environment that is seeing high turbulence in speculative stocks paired with a coming rotation to value incoming. TAP is poised to take off like a rocket and can be considered a safe haven in this moment of uncertainty.

Table below representing TAP's share price given the same multiples as BUD. I have also placed a technical forecast chart of future share price.

hoping my puts print so I can get in more with you degenerates but I guess we will have to wait and see!!

* Net sales were $1.297 billion for the quarter, compared to $1.005 billion in the prior year’s third quarter.
* Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships, such as Samsung, LG, Razer, Vizio and others, contributed to the Company's growth in the quarter.
* Inventory was $1.141 billion at the close of the quarter, compared to $861 million at the close of the prior year’s third quarter, reflecting the Company’s focus on front-loading investments in inventory to meet increased customer demand and mitigate supply chain issues.
* Ended the period with cash and cash equivalents of $1.413 billion as well as no debt other than a $46.2 million low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government’s response to COVID-19.
* Established new offices in Seattle, Washington and Boston, Massachusetts, which are technology hubs with established talent markets.
* Secured a new $500 million ABL facility, which closed in November just after the end of the third quarter, with improved liquidity and terms, including reduced borrowing costs, lighter covenants and additional flexibility.

13433,OTLY any1???,rbxivm,"What is the topic with OTLY???

I recently decided to start making a change into a more “vegan” lifestyle on the back of health concerns bla bla bla…. Truth is I am too much of a meat lover and also thought I could never find an alternative to dairy… meat alternatives I don’t consider as I prefer to just eat veggies and not that fake meat (bynd, Tyson, impossible foods are all just as bad to me)…. But now, that I discovered OTLY I am going crazy! It’s actually super good, not sure if any1 here agrees?

Having mentioned this, I saw that their stock has been getting hammered down to abt 8$ so decided to buy some 15 March calls. Now, where I really like this company, I see their revs have pretty much doubled from 200mln usd to above 600mln usd per year since 2019 and as they have been ramping up their production their net income estimates for end of this year might amount to even more than 200mln loss. They have such amazing products I really think many people in Europe love so I have no doubt they will turn this around.

Is any1 also in on OTLY? Any thoughts worth for discussion?

I recently have fallen into the dark depths of Zillow (ZG) and the fundamentals after their recent housing disaster. I've found out that they are a total shit company, have a ton of debt, and aren't that profitable. How exactly they have a 15+ billion dollar market cap is for a whole 'other day, ii guess it is what it is.

Anyhoo, I looked at their insider trading (public & attached) and found that all their Chief Officers offloaded all their shares during the shit-storm of the past couple months that they've recently had (-45%!). How the fuck is this shit legal. Where the hell is mister Gary captain SEC or anybody.How the hell can these insiders sell their shares, trade options, and then make stupid press releases that drive up the share prices.Down with Zillow, I hope they burn. In insider trading hell.

Lets make them go bankrupt, I want some chicken tendies

13573,Just hear me out - ZNGA,rbuxm9,"Zynga - I believe there is a ton of opportunity here. 

52 week high was $12.34, currently trading in the $6.50 range, the lowest it has been since the pandemic started (oversold?). They recently released a harry potter themed game (Sept) which is rated 4.8 stars on the apple app store with over 134,000 reviews. They also have an upcoming Star Wars themed game set for release in 2022 which will be on Nintendo switch as well as mobile. So a lot of hype around them getting involved in popular franchises and expanding from their traditional iOS, Android roots. 

They are also set to release their next earnings on February 9th. 2/18 10c is currently trading at around .12 per contract. Assuming the harry potter game is able to produce decent revenue numbers and with the potential of more COVID related lockdowns/people being at home or inside more, mobile gaming is poised to see a bump during the winter months. 

All of this culminating in high upside leading up to their earnings call. Not even shooting for new record highs, just a modest return to what the stock was trading at between January and July of this year.

13620,Whole Market Analysis + My take on recent market correction,rbtzwy,"**Hey there! I'm actually new here :)** I'm posting a whole trove of analysis, so BE WARNED - this post is very long and very wordy. Currently all analysis is NOT algorithmic (hoping to be in the future :)) - just data driven + some gut feeling :)

ANYWAYS the future events you might need to follow + my analysis of the market correction: (I might have gotten SOME dates wrong)

1. December 3 - US Budget deadline ([averted Gov shutdown](https://www.investopedia.com/government-shutdown-averted-5211630). People were even worried about a Sat/Sun shutdown!). Pushed back to Feb 18 2022.
2. December 10 - [US Inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi). Inflation October was 6.2%. Inflation expectations for November is 6.8%. Generally pre Inflation, markets become ""horizontal"" to wait for the results.
3. December 15 - [US Federal Reserve Meeting](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm). Interestingly during the Nov 26 to last week correction, [Powell said Omnicron](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/a-major-shift-is-underway-at-the-federal-reserve-that-could-see-a-speedier-end-to-its-easy-policies.html) might muddy the Fed's take on ""transitory"" inflation, and according to analysts, they might taper at x2 speed. Likewise pre FOMC, markets become ""horizontal"" or even tinnily drop.
4. December 15 to 21 - [Debt Ceiling ""deadline""](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-government-could-miss-payments-soon-dec-21-think-tank-2021-12-03/). [New news - Mitch McConnell](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/debt-limit-deal-mcconnell-schumer/index.html) seems to have brokered a deal with the Dems to allow them to pass the Debt ceiling with first Dem house support, then 60 votes in the Senate. He said he's confident 10 GOP will vote with Dems to extend the debt.
5. End December - [Possible Build Back Better](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/wall-street-believes-biden-build-back-better-bill-will-become-law.html). The tax on billionares + the recent extra tax in states like Washington MIGHT have caused many [insiders to sell $70B](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/ceos-and-insiders-sell-a-record-69-billion-of-their-stock.html) or so of stock.
6. December 17 - [Quadruple Witching](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp) (options expires) Every 3rd Friday of March, June, Sept, Dec, options and futures expires. The next is 17 Dec. \[Still analysing past historical data on general average trend movements\]
7. Omnicron seems fine for now. [Pfizer 9th Dec just](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pfizer-says-booster-dose-vaccine-protects-omicron-variant-rcna7970) released a statement showing a 2nd dose looks weaker (as expected), but seems to work for severe illness prevention (need more data). However a 3rd dose seems to be the same effectiveness as a 2nd dose for other strains. Sadly [Merck's drug got](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-says-covid-19-pill-cuts-hospitalization-death-risk-by-30-2021-11-26/) downgraded from 50% effectiveness to 30% HOWEVER it's still useful. It got approved by the FDA recently. Pfizer's 85% effective drug seems to be MAYBE approved by the [end of December](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/science/merck-pfizer-covid-pill-treatment.html).
8. [Yield Curve](https://money.cnn.com/data/bonds/) has finally ""recovered"" again. The slope dramatically decreased during the recent Nov 26 to now market correction. An inverted yield curve signals that a possible recession is on the horizon. Currently, the yield curve is not inverted.[However, some unease is possible](http://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/united-states/), since the 30Y yield is actually LOWER than the 20Y yield. A ""confident"" market is when 1M < 3M < 6M < 1Y < 2Y < 5Y < 10Y < 20Y < 30Y yield rates. A recession seems unlikely for now - HOWEVER since it's like the harbinger of chaos - it's possible in 6 months or 1 year time a recession MIGHT be possible, assuming the current trajectory of the Yield Curve continues. \[More analysis needed\]
9. The market correction possible began November 8. Dow Jones already started sliding. This was actually imo first due to the US Debt Ceiling (Dec 15), Inflation, US Budget deadlines (Dec 3). Likewise people probably ""felt"" billionares would start selling their stocks though unlikely. In general, at the start, people became risk averse. Likewise, the [CNN Fear and Greed Index](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) was phenomenally high, which is abnormal. Then came Omnicron 1-2 weeks before the deadlines (Nov 24 first detected). It was sadly like a black swan event. So it made the market tank even further. NASDAQ then reversed as well.
10. [Evergrande again seems to be in trouble](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-08/evergrande-default-debt-developers-china/100682242). [China's yield curve](https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/china/) looks fine so that's reassuring. Or maybe the bond market hasn't taken this externality seriously. More analysis is needed.

As a side note, to show my credentials to show I'm not making crap up:

* I'm actually an avid poster in HotCopper (some Australian stock discussion board).  I generally post about Lynas Rare Earths (LYSCF / ASX:LYC). I have around 110K views, and I post general market analysis.
* For example on [26th November](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/my-prediction-market-correction-next-few-weeks.6450544/), I posted a bit late about possible market corrections.
* You can check my [general profile out](https://hotcopper.com.au/search/1504084/?q=%2A&t=post&o=relevance&c%5Bvisible%5D=true&c%5Buser%5D%5B0%5D=821569).
* My superannuation is with [UniSuper's Global Environment Oppurtunies](https://www.unisuper.com.au/investments/our-investment-options/global-environmental-opportunities). I help my parents trade by giving whole market advice starting this July.  They buy LYC, ORE now AKE, obviously some banks, ETFs like CLNE (clean energy), and more.

Anyways hope my long analysis is useful!!!!

13701,Goldman Sachs Weekly Options Watch,rbrv13," Buying calls around analyst days has averaged +13% return on premium in 2021 and we see the potential for increased profitability this December. With macro concerns largely driving the recent increase in equity market volatility, we believe investors should position for relief rallies in stocks where management is likely to reassure investors regarding the current environment and outlook. Historically, companies have scheduled analyst days in December to provide investors with updated forward-looking guidance, discuss their outlooks for the subsequent year or discuss their long-term business strategy. With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting year-end corporate events for many companies last year, we expect this year's analyst days to increase in number and significance, especially as companies potentially start to look beyond the impact of the pandemic.

Trade #1: Buy calls on Airline stocks with upcoming Analyst Days; **LUV** (8-Dec), **DAL** (16-Dec) and **HA** (13-Dec) are hosting analyst days for the first time since the pandemic.

Trade #2: Buy **NKE** straddles ahead of earnings on 20-Dec; supply chain related disruptions could drive higher than normal volatility on earnings.

Trade #3: Buy **LULU** straddles ahead of earnings on 09-Dec; potential for higher freight costs derailing strong momentum.

Trade #4: Buy calls ahead of **COMM** analyst day on 14-Dec; management is expected to provide a detailed road map on strategic transformation process.",1638971690.0

AMC was bleeding until December 3 ; it's now trading on support

So AMC is probably going to bounce back soon, but you shouldn't buy right now ;

So you should wait for a pullback ; and there will be one soon

[you can also see a resistance that could be broken](https://preview.redd.it/6aadwbpnk9481.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=40cef35ec373ff90206d9d9dc63db00c32cb7d8b)

From subscriptions for seat warmers being adopted by other car companies to criminally poor customer service and fighting the right to repair... on a car!? 

This company is going to make so many changes to this industry for the worse if left unchecked (and honestly has already)

13988,Is 2021 the new 2008 for the Real Estate Market?,rbd599,"Real estate is one of society's largest, oldest industries and has managed to resist significant disruption for many decades. According to the latest news, the performance of major housing companies is getting tougher, and my observations also confirm this.

In general, most indirect indicators signal us about a forthcoming crisis - hiring activity has significantly decreased, investors are pessimistic, and the short interest level is growing for most of the main players.

We all saw that **better.com** (a pre-IPO company) [fired 900 employees](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/05/business/better-ceo-fires-employees/index.html). CEO said - «The market has changed, as you know, and we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and deliver on our mission».

It looks like a powerful signal, so from words to data! Let's take a quick overview of the main US real-estate-related companies and try to understand the overall market situation:

**1. Opendoor Technologies Inc. (**[**$OPEN**](https://contora.ai/ticker/open)**)** \- the biggest player in the real estate market.

If you're a home buyer or potential real estate investor, you need to be paying attention to what's going on with Opendoor since they buy and sell more homes in the US than anyone else. And if they're crashing down - that's definitely a strong signal of what you can expect to see in the whole housing market. The $OPEN stock is already 30% down over November:

[$OPEN stock](https://preview.redd.it/izkda8psj7481.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=4864517dbf54643b1eddc48ea8ccadd6904290d8)

We can see a constantly growing [short interests level](https://contora.ai/ticker/open#short_interest_level) for $OPEN as well, which means that the company is actively being shorted:

[$OPEN short interest](https://preview.redd.it/5qzxlsqvj7481.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb96aa5114c6f1b7f1c720f3c200d14a5243521b)

Another bad sign for Opendoor is the growth of [insiders selling activity](https://contora.ai/ticker/open#insider_trading_activity):

[$OPEN insider activity](https://preview.redd.it/kdz1o0fxj7481.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=8766b0d5b62fff01a2e794d209e22c04310d27bf)

When these insiders sell the stock, it's only natural for outsiders to wonder if something is afoot. But with the support of other powerful signals - it's crazily bad :(

**2. Zillow Group (**[**$ZG**](https://contora.ai/ticker/zg)**)** \- Opendoor's largest competitor, a digital real estate company, operates real estate brands on mobile applications and websites in the United States.

The second negative signal was made by Zillow company a month ago - its stock price has reduced significantly.

[$ZG stock](https://preview.redd.it/78yl3uzyj7481.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=a658f375fcdc9aa15adcf63dc3f13ea10b2b0a61)

The number of [open job positions](https://contora.ai/ticker/zg#job_openings) at Indeed and Glassdoor has dropped to zero, which means that $ZG can't afford to hire employees:

[$ZG hiring dynamics](https://preview.redd.it/jpx6zh31k7481.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab73dd967ca441f7068f9fc7fa5436b9fc66692f)

And situation with [short interests level](https://contora.ai/ticker/zg#short_interest_level) is similar to $OPEN's:

[$ZG short interest](https://preview.redd.it/zyl87ox3k7481.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=f043a23951fba4750538ad41fda80634b5e9e72d)

**3. Redfin Corporation (**[**$RDFN**](https://contora.ai/ticker/rdfn)**)** \- a residential real estate brokerage company in the United States and Canada.

The third company in a list - a third bad sign. The Redfin's shares dropped 20.9% in November:

[$RDFN](https://preview.redd.it/nxtythj5k7481.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a0f715382338dcb3c79f90e254682136ef21dc)

At present, $RDFN has a market cap of $4 billion. But Redfin only generated low numbers in gross profit over this year and had no net income:

[$RDFN fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/0tnfzup7k7481.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fde31d2964ff983cb68e3017fbed669a0050157)

If it's unable to grow its business over the coming years, the stock will likely fall even more from here. Also, the company is [actively being shorted](https://contora.ai/ticker/rdfn#short_interest_level) over the past few months as well:

[$RDFN short interest level](https://preview.redd.it/s1qke3y8k7481.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4dbd949ac4bdb7f7c01dec4f6b271a8ff66b82)

What are your thoughts on the real estate market? This is a fairly quick overview of the current market situation, but even from these facts, we can understand that the housing market is going through a period of turbulence.

I'm hoping it goes up (of course not passed $1350). Then I plan to repeat this, though next time I'll probably select a target high enough as to be less likely to get called, as I would like to hold my shares indefinitely.  Also, I used that 37K to buy 35 more shares of TSLA... if the strategy works out, in 6-8 months maybe I'll have enough for 8 calls.

I realize that TSLA could pop at any time and I'll miss out on a lot of upside, but honestly I'd be cool with selling @ $1350 a share. And if it goes down (like it did lately) by Feb 18, I'll just adjust and sell more covered calls.

Please tell me if my strategy is foolish/flawed.   I am fairly newb to this.  Thanks!

14083,BLACK THURSDAY 12/16/2021 (Why I think the market will start a 30-50% next week),rb9uk4,"In early May 2021 I posted this TA [why I think the market will see a 30-50% correction by September](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n30u1l/why_i_think_the_market_will_see_a_3050_correction/)

In that post I highlighted several key reasons why I was theorizing the market would begin a sharp pullback and rally back to 200sma in the winter of 2021.

Shortly after making that post a series of events occurred over the next 7 months which have led me to lose a large amount of investment funds. Instead of trying to recoup those funds through day trading, I have taken the last 6 months to analyze, plot, and devise the proper re-entry for playing the market correction. Below you will find a short reflection of the time since my last post which has led me to my current positions.

**14x - $25 VIX call 1/19/2022** 

# TIMELINE:

* **5/3** \- I post my TA with the thesis that by September the Fed will have defaulted on their debts, supply shortages going rampant, and inflation would have grown to a level unsustainable for the average person. - **PULLBACK STARTS**
* **5/3-5/12** \- News runs constant stories on the rising inflation and oil prices. **PULLBACK of 4+%**
* **5/13** \- Mask mandate abruptly lifted, Markets rally and people think COVID is ending - **RALLY \*KEY MOMENT IN HISTORY\***
* **5/31** \- Delta variant hits US - **RALLY FADES**
* **6/18** \- Fed announces for first time they will raise rates in 2023 - **PULLBACK OF 3+%**
* **7/19** \- US indoor masking returns and UK lifts restrictions - **RALLY**
* **8/2** \- Extraordinary measures begin - **RALLY FADES**
* **9/7** \- Fear begins growing that taper will begin in November - **START OF PULLBACK**
* **9/7 - 9/21** \- Evergrande Begins collapsing, debt ceiling decision stalling grows default fears, investors fear fed will announce tapering at FOMC meeting - **PULLBACK CONTINUES**
* **9/21 - 9/23** \- FOMC meeting: Powell mentions nothing of tapering and cites that if the debt ceiling is not raised it will have severe implications on the market. Fears grow as the fed indicated last week it will soon begin reducing its monthly bond purchases. - **PULLBACK CONTINUES**
* **9/27 - 10/7** \- Debt ceiling fears spark massive sell off. - **FIRST 5+% PULLBACK SINCE FEB2020**
* **10/8** \- Debt Ceiling passed - **RALLY**
* **10/8-CURRENT** \- Debt Ceiling bought the Fed 2 months of cash. Investors jump back in the market buying full force. - **BIGGEST RALLY OF THEM ALL**

# November 30th Federal Reserve Release (THE WARNING):

The Treasury has reached the new debt limit of $28.9 trillion, it has no room to borrow under its standard operating procedures, other than to replace maturing debt. To avoid breaching the limit, the Treasury is using the **extraordinary measures** that allow it to continue to borrow additional amounts for a **limited time**. Treasury has announced that it will implement a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) by transferring $118 billion to the Highway Trust Fund on December 15. CBO projects that the Treasury will most likely run out of cash before the end of December. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and the credit rating agencies would react with downgrades. Yellen may have the authority to delay the transfer or break it into smaller payments but that would only keep the Treasury account afloat for a few more weeks.

[Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, earlier or later than CBO projects.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57653)

**12/06** \- Senate Republicans are rejecting a proposal floated by congressional Democratic leaders to attach a debt limit fix to the annual defense policy measure — typically treated as a must-pass bill and thought as the last hope for passing a new debt ceiling before the X date.

# UPCOMING DECEMBER FED PAYMENTS OUT OF Treasury account: Balance=$152bil

**12/15** \- Highway Trust Payment = **$115bil**

**12/15** \- Interest payment = **+/-$50bil**

**12/15** \- SSA payment = $**20bil**

# Treasury Account DRAWDOWN MACRO IMPLICATIONS:

* money market rates may come under pressure.
* the wave of liquidity expected to be released could prove inflationary if credit demand is strong

# CURRENT ASSEST PURCHASING REDUCTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH

The Fed would need to increase asset purchasing reductions to **$15 Billion per month** and stopping after 8months to stop a default in 2022 with the current debt ceiling raising rules.

# CONCLUSION:

**There is not enough time between now and the 15th to stop a default at the current stage of debate in the Senate. The credit rating agencies aren't going to be the scapegoat again like 2008.**

**S&P Global Ratings (S&P)**, **Moody's**, and **Fitch Group** have all issued downgrade warnings.

14110,The next DOCU... the PATH to nowhere,rb95vh,"Like many of you, I have been looking at the gain porn from some of these recent COVID stock dumps through this earnings season green with envy. I had a feeling Zoom would dump but then saw the decline into earnings and thought it was priced in already (it wasn’t) same deal with PTON. I didn’t see the DOCU dive coming but have been looking at all the companies in this weeks earnings calendar to try to find one I think is primed up for a similar nose-dive.

Alas, I believe I have found a wonderful set-up!! UiPath (PATH) releases Q3 Earnings on Wednesday AH.

UiPath (PATH) is a newly IPO’d tech company which issued shares publicly April 20th at **$56/share.**

It is a RPA software provider which stands for “robotics as a service”. I have used their service at my job and I’ll admit it is pretty cool. It is essentially a “macro” just like Excel, which can replicate a repetitive computer process by recording the mouse click-path or short-keys to do a simple data process. For example: if you sign in ever day to a website, export data into an Excel workbook, format and scrub it with formula’s and then sent an email with the report to a team, this could be automated with UiPath’s RPA. So they would record you doing all those steps across platforms, and then it would be able to run that process on a daily script each morning saving you the time of all that manual, repetitive steps. As a client, you pay \~$5-10k per “process” they help automate. This can usually be justified as it saves me 1 hour a day x 250 business days per year therefore its greater human time savings then the cost of the bot.

My case for why this is primed for a come to jesus moment is its current valuation. It currently generates revenues of \~$200 million/quarter, so you are looking at \~$800 million year revenues and the market cap is **$26 BILLION** (32.5x trailing P/S ratio, yikes!). This company has not and will not turn a profit for YEARS. Despite impressive growth over the last year, I think they are in store for a big re-rate on what they are worth on a forward looking basis.

Bullet points for my bearish read:

· Insiders all started selling following last quarter’s earnings report black-out including CEO, CFO and Directors (they are selling in the $50’s…)

· Mama Cathie Wood is the 6th largest shareholder with 24 Million shares. We know how her recent track-record has played out on some of her other high-growth, unprofitable holdings…

· Company lost $340 million in the last six months, $100 million in the last three months, although current client base is “sticky” I don’t think they will be able to out-grow more significant losses in the future.

· DOCU took a multiple hair-cut after their Q3, looks like they trade now at 14.3x EV/Revenue. PATH is currently trading at 30.2x, re-valuing at DOCU’s multiple, puts PATH at a $12 Billion valuation (50% lower than current).

**TLDR: PATH has a similar set-up and valuation going into earnings as DOCU. Their current valuation is heavily influenced by high growth in the next 3-5 years. Anything less then stellar should see it trade < $40/share in my opinion. Today’s rally in my opinion was a gift for entry into puts.** *\*Not financial advice, just my reasoning behind my position below\**

By a report of Handelsblatt, Volkswagen is thinking of offering an IPO of Porsche. This would allow the Porsche family to get a decision making stake in Porsche. It would give VW some much needed capital for electrification and also make the shareholders happy, while still keeping a VW majority share in Porsche. Win-win-win.

Volkswagen is currently valued at like 110bn, Porsche is estimated to be valued between 60 and 80bn. Again, vw owns 100% of Porsche.

Good morning WSBers,

I know we're all used to DD posts with a shit ton of random catalysts and no fundamentals, but I'd like to do the opposite today. See, we value a company by how much money they can return for each dollar we invest in them. Usually a good return is around 10% per year for a mature company (I know, I know, this is extremely generalized and returns should be evaluated within industries and blablabla). But what about ZIM?

ZIM's market cap is around $6.6 billion dollars.

They are making a net profit of $3.3 billion dollars this year.

This means every for every two dollar you put in this company, it makes $1 of PROFIT! Not revenue, PROFITS! While people are out here shilling their tech bags who MIGHT become profitable in 2024 if they maintain an incredible growth rate, we're missing out on companies like ZIM who return over 50% of your investments within a year!

Now you might say ""companies with low P/Es are usually valued this way because they are deeply flawed or project a decrease in revenue"" and you'd be right for the second part. The main reason ZIM has been printing money faster than J Powell this year is because freight rates exploded due to supply chain issues. Analysts covering the company are giving it a price target of 73$ (currently in the high 50s) while taking into consideration a rapid return to baseline for freight rates in 2022.

But right now, that's not happening (rates have been stagnant over the last couple months) and even if somebody finds a magical solution to rapidly unfuck the clusterfuck that is our supply chain by magically teleporting the backlog of bullshit we ordered for the past Idk how many months from the ships that have been waiting weeks outside of LA directly to the consumers, analysts failed to take into consideration ZIM's acquisition of 7 new vessels (five 4,250 TEU vessels and two 1,100 TEU vessels).

This DD is kinda short, but if you guys go read some articles on ZIM, you'd realize how good of a deal it is! My study break is over but I hope I managed to convince some of y'all to hop on the rocket ship with me.

Tighten your helmets and get your tongue off the window to answer this:

1. Omicron fears have rightly dissipated which *surely* is incredibly bearish: it just means less Fed nannying and intervening to prop up asset prices and that could mean the dreaded but necessary taper™ announcement is likely in this Decembers meeting - how the fuck are we not in a massive sell off?
2. I understand that a permabull in CNBC (which I usually give as much credence as the shoeshine who told you to go all-in on Enron calls)  mentioned that since capital has nowhere else to flow at 0.1% yield with shitty boomer bonds, stocks are still going to be rallying until the rates actually go up, but then why was there a 20 point drop last week at the mere *hint* of a taper? Yet as the most bearish news  (for SPY, not the economy) of seemingly no lockdowns or drastic measures to Omicron is in, what has changed to make the market rally so fucking hard today? Is this the final furlong and the coda of the musical chairs that will result in a lot of autists standing around without a seat as the lights come on like prom night?
3. Have supply chain issues, CHINA, and a stagnating labour force ALL been resolved?

14397,DraftKings - $DKNG DD – Bullish case for explosive upside and Squeeze on Jim Chanos,rb1gbd,"**Disclaimer: This is based on what I've researched and to the best of my ability. Do your own DD. Obligatory this is not an investment advice.**

**TLDR** – Jim Chanos is shorting DKNG, he’s a well-known shorter so other firms are probably piggybacking his trades and are short DKNG as well, same set up as Melvin capital and all the firms that hopped on their GME short, big mistake for DKNG shorts, the best quarter is about to come up, plus new states opened up for even more revenue that was not included in the forward guidance. In addition Jim Chanos went on CNBC and completely shit the bed with his bear math, and got all the fundamentals wrong about this stock.

DKNG is also well capitalized to continue to grow, even in a low interest rate environment, which makes this stock unlike the other growth stocks being sold off, because spending is within control and strategic, not at risk to have to raise capital to dilute shareholders. The company is moving toward Web 3.0 and is becoming more of a tech company then just a regular gambling company.

How does the price explode, short covering + short covering on dark pools, options gamma squeeze after breakout, Algos forced to de-basket DKNG from short high growth stock basket related to ARKK and macro event driven Algos (interest rates, j-pow tapering and money printer slowing down)

**Price Point = $90+ in honour of Jim Chanos and claim that DKNG trades 30x revenue**.

**Reason #1 - Jim Chanos**

https://preview.redd.it/exmjq5a705481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0a1bb8451dd2b75b9b35c9a335bd159179206e

This guy is smart, caught Enron’s accounting fraud but he’s lost his touch.

He shorted TSLA – [https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd](https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd)

He hates meme stocks and those who trade them - [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8)

Now he’s shorting DKNG but using bogus math to do it and hoping Apes don’t know basic arithmetic.

He’s quoted in this interview [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash) with the following reasons to short DKNG:

“DraftKings has a valuation right now of 30 times runway revenue,” he told CNBC. “You can believe in sports betting ... but this business model is flawed.”

Response from the CEO :

https://preview.redd.it/1n2pxbf805481.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae8a1422235ff93384d909ebe8d960501206bee

**Jason’s right, market cap was never 30x revenue, revenue consensus for 2021 is 1.2 billion, Jim Is suggesting the market cap is $36 Billion, DKNG has not come close to that in the past few months and the current market cap $12.72 Billion.**

“If you quadrupled DraftKings’ revenue and gross profit ... and take their marketing spending, which is currently over 100% of revenue, to 10% of revenue, which is their target, and you keep overhead at today’s level ... DraftKings would still be losing $200 million a quarter,” Chanos said.

Below is from the income statement, 4x revenue gives you 851,276, he said take the marketing spending and make it 10% of revenue, so that’s 85,127.6. Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he’s gone senile.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqtolml905481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af724b9f388a8d3796b5af8264eeeba33c0156a3

Changing a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.

Only reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.

**Reason #2 – upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**

Shorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.

During the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.

Upsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season

**Huge growth**

&#x200B;

Growth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.

physical casino’s are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.

**Inside buying – always a good sign**

We have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft’s CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company’s future.

**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**

We get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that’s a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.

But as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.

So, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it’s not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m336726f05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5fe731d8dd9510c83bac21be45a8f85568ff30

The below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG. They have a large cash balance, little to no change in cash over quarters and have already stated an equity offering would only come after the stock passes $125.

&#x200B;

DKNG can be the next Amazon or TSLA, in this case the physical casinos are physical retail and legacy auto. The growth story is the same, operate at a loss, continue to growth, kill the competition, and disrupt the market.

**Trend change - Not just a Covid Play**

More and more people are betting online, and this is disruptive to physical casinos. Even with the emergence of physical casinos into the online space like BetMGM and Penn with barstool, the motivation to pursue this area is not strong with physical casinos, due to cannibalizing themselves.

We see in this article [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks) , a huge trend change, over 64% of bets came from online, and this is in Nevada, a destination for physical casinos, imagine the rest of the country. And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.

**Espn deal + twitter**

ESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions. Same with twitter as the access to users opens opportunities to market and convert new users.

**Differentiation from current gambling stocks**

DraftKing’s has a strong focus on innovation as you can see by their patent filings, they focus on customer retention, which is a huge competitive advantage in this space, when customers can be swayed from one app to another with free promos. [https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents](https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents)

They are becoming more vertically integrated, will own their own data in the future and have incorporated the tech stake from SBtech.

The entire exec team is focused on Web 3.0 and hired or is hiring for this next phase in gambling. Internally they continue to innovate beyond new games, and this is unique to DKNG, you can go on the job sites for MGM or Caesars and you won’t find any jobs for an engineering team, this is not an area they have any interest in, this is literally Sears vs Amazon at this point, physical casinos will always have Vegas as destination spot but not much else in a few years.

Most analyst except 1 are extremely bullish on the future for DKNG and the average price point remains around 2x the current trading price, they can’t all be wrong.

**Reason #3 - Heavy short sales in Dark Pools - Over 40% + Algo basket trading manipulation**

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng)

For those interested, shorts are piling on through dark pools. Potential exist to squeeze. The use of dark pools is very interesting as we know this is to hide the obvious intention to tank the stock but the level it’s reaching is becoming absurd.

Showing similar level of manipulation that exists in AMC and CLOV, known hedge fund manipulated stocks. DKNG showing sharp declines in price despite upcoming catalyst of state legalizations and during crucial sports betting half of the calendar year.

**DKNG is showing the same level of dark pool shorting as NKLA a known fraud stock**. This make no sense other than manipulation to pin down the price for market makers to make money on options expiring worthless.

**Algos shorting ARKK stocks**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/svgfze4t05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78d913cc4e69c5fbbf51cc80202e582708c419e

We see seemingly unrelated stocks moving down with each other for no reason. Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn’t have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.

**Gamma Squeeze Potential**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qc2rmlqt05481.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=eac416148759bc6fe638e5680a02acbc3ce9fff9

DKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.

Option chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks

For those wondering, here is a 101 on [How to Deduct Stock Losses From Your Tax Bill](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp). KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Realized capital losses from stocks can be used to reduce your tax bill.

* You can use capital losses to offset capital gains during a taxable year, allowing you to remove some income from your tax return.

* If you don’t have capital gains to offset the capital loss, you can use a capital loss as an offset to ordinary income, up to $3,000 per year.
* To deduct your stock market losses, you have to fill out Form 8949 and Schedule D for your tax return.

* If you own stock that has become worthless because the company went bankrupt and was liquidated, then you can take a total capital loss on the stock.",1638877543.0

It's been said that private equity groups have a growing appetite for UK retail assets, with Clayton Dubilier & Rice recently paying $10 billion for grocer WM Morrison. A sale on the same 9 times EBITDA multiple could value Boots at somewhere around $8 billion or so. Walgreens already sold most of its European drug distribution business for $6.5 billion earlier this year.

14560,RIVN and LCID are 100-billion-dollar meme stocks and their share prices will sink harder than Cathie's ARK,raturi,"RIVN and LCID make TSLA look like a value stock, and it is a complete fucking joke.

I get it. RIVN and LCID make nice cars. Quality. Award-worthy. High price targets from shill, delusional analysts. 

Don't fucking forget: RIVN and LCID are **STARTUPS**. They are not profitable and have little or zero revenue. THEY AREN'T EVEN SOFTWARE STARTUPS. Meaning, their margins will be shit for a long, long time. Inflation will squeeze their margins too. All of this is assuming they can ever scale production. 

Do you know how hard it is to build a successful car company against entrenched titans? It took one of the world's greatest serial entrepreneurs **ever**, a Benjamin Franklin, a Henry Ford of our time, a devout technologist and futurist, almost TWO DECADES to achieve profitability with a car company. Tesla delivered their first cars (the Roadster) in 2008, **13 years ago**. The EV market had green pastures at the time. 

With sky-high operational costs to scale, LCID and RIVN won't be profitable for several years, and they will have to rely on share issuance to fund capex and operations, diluting existing shareholders. They will be competing with the old titans and the new. If their share price tanks and aren't able to raise capital because their sector has fallen out of favor, they will be completely fucked. **The most likely 10-year outcome for RIVN and LCID is bankruptcy.** 

Years from now, people will say, why the fuck did people in 2021 not see they were peak bubble when RIVN IPO'd with zero revenue and a valuation of 150B? The truth is, bears, bulls, and observers all have become numb to obscene valuations this year. Some are starting to wake up to a harsh reality, but the EV tickers are still floating on cloud 9, blissfully ignorant to the bloodbath ahead. That's why I feel this trade isn't crowded yet, not in the slightest. 

IV is super high, but given how far overstretched these companies are, it doesn't even fucking matter, because I truly believe they will lose 80-90% of their market cap. Pidgey JPow has evolved into Pidgeotto JPow, swaths of the speculative markets have rolled over, macro fundamentals are terrible, and this absurdity cannot continue for long. LCID will go to the way of SPCE... just a few months later. Looking for 10-baggers with these positions:

* RIVN March 22 55p
* LCID May 22 21p

None of this is financial advice. No matter which way this moves in the short-term, I cannot fucking wait to watch the inevitable carnage to these EV-bros and shit-cos... or to my portfolio and ego.",1638863215.0

Today, there was a blip in the data which looks an awful lot like ratings manipulation towards an app owned by $ATUS",rataeh,"I’ve been tracking data on apps run by publicly traded companies on my investment data platform, and I came across a phenomenon that seems suspect at best.

‘Hype Score’ is a metric I developed to quantify hype towards apps using a variety of inputs. The formula is fairly complex, but all you need to know is that today there was a large outlier today, as pictured below.

[Hype Score. Altice One on right.](https://preview.redd.it/dvg73wg1l2481.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1674d4d0c0a27ec09e4d04aff7be3baef144979)

Before today, the Altice One app owned by $ATUS has been averaging less than one new rating a day. The average score of these old ratings was 2.03.

Today, the Altice One app got over 300 new ratings. The average score of these new ratings was 4.61.

I haven’t seen any evidence of any changes or improvements made to the app today. It seems suspect at best that the app went from getting 50 overwhelmingly negative ratings over the span of three months to getting 300 overwhelmingly positive ratings over the span of a day on no news. 

Apps like Snapchat often barely get 300 ratings in a day, I find it hard to believe that an app which only had 525 ratings to begin with got 300 new, positive ratings organically.",1638860925.0

14600,Just speculating here:,raqos3,"# Degenerates buying puts

Markets have been beat up, quite noticeably beneath the surface over the last few weeks. That being said, volatility actually has really gotten ahead of itself, and oversupply of people buying premium means the major indexes are less likely to deteriorate in the near term. As those put options decay, it will force markets back upwards, and that will be further exasperated as implied volatility falls. Your calls and puts are going to slowly Vega away. 

#China

Chinese equities are seriously beat up and oversold on a technical level. Not a great fundamental situation there long term, but I wouldn't be trying to short chinese stocks until sentiment and positioning level out at least a small bit. 

I wouldn't invest in any chinese companies long term, but maybe as a shorter term trade (if you're a retard), it may not be a bad time to take some shots at mean reversion. Keep in mind, there will likely be at least some easing coming in 2022, and news of that may start sooner rather than later. 

That being said, I still think the situation is cooked there long term, and I also think there is still risk for losing control of the situation.

#Taxes

End of year will likely bring out sellers in anything that has been bad all year and buyers in whatever was a winner. Both for tax purposes as well as for the purpose window dressing.

#Closing time

TLDR: I would speculate that we will recover here for a bit going into christmas, but I don't think it's going to be a recovery to all time highs or anything.",1638851397.0

14612,SPY Options Outlook for 17 DEC OPEX and End of Week,raqafw,"A quick look at SPY. First off, I'm bullish on this week. Not sure what sort of macro stuff is sitting out there but from the options/gamma standpoint it looks good.

The model require you to buy into the following assumptions

* Dealers hedge net directional risk
* Dealers are net short all options. This isn't true but it's a necessary error and is generally close
* Market prices are liquidity seeking (generally true)

This is a chart of dealer gamma/liquidty into OPEX. Each trend line is for a fixed spot price.

&#x200B;

[Sorry I hate Excel graphics too](https://preview.redd.it/43psms2tl1481.jpg?width=1658&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74472c3a6c0ddbbe7a7a5b00cfe52a757fe32045)

There's an enormous dislocation in gamma at a $471 spot price . That's causing the weird spike on the overall distribution of Γ on the chart below. That is at $470.8-$470.9 precisely. The normalized  maximum Γ is at $468.9 (disregarding enormous spike.) That is where the most liquidity is being provided and subsequently where the spot price should gravitate towards. 🤞

&#x200B;

[Estimated Dealer Γ with respect to Spot price](https://preview.redd.it/rnuabj71m1481.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=5515d37ee70d946abcb422de4951ef00c9ddacac)

I haven't tried to interpret the model this way but I think it should be insightful. One problem is expiring contracts decrease the overall Γ. No way around this one without telling the future OI. But the ordering of those trendlines and the slope between price points at the same date. This is a rough 3D visualization. Needs some work to be quantitatively useful but gets the idea across.

&#x200B;

[Surface plot of first chart](https://preview.redd.it/s0hosgu5n1481.jpg?width=1580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=340eb9ff81f3c590254d0ac98c43b587aa804f89)

The price region we're in ($460-$462) has an increasing slope which means liquidity is found at higher price points **and** the spot price move faster upwards here (if you buy the assumption prices are liquidity seeking). This is bullish.

Next up, Dealer Hedging

\*Haven't rigorously tested this concept\* Dealers are net short for the 10 DEC OPEX by \~4m shares. That bodes well into end of week and beginning of next as those short hedges are unwound and MMs buy back shares or futures. 4m shares is only 6% of daily volume and a significant amount of hedging is done with futures and options so idk.

**Looking towards OPEX is tricky and the second OI updates tomorrow this may all drastically change. It's happened before. But following that plot, the price points with the highest liquidity (and higher likelihood of occurring) are $472-$474. That's 250 basis points on the SP in a week which is possible but seems far fetched. Anyways that's what the numbers say.**

P/E is 9. Stock has been trading sideways for a year because dumbass previous CEO was an inbred mongoloid who hired a random hooker as VP and some guy from Qualcomm (with 0 foundry expérience) as tech lead. 

The New CEO though, he isn't fucking around. [New chip design is quickly closing the gap with AMD.](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus).

Im writing this post in hopes to get some feedback from the place of self-made milioners /Homeless people. I've been keeping an eye on Activison Blizzard for some time now as the stock is trading lower from its all time high by 40+%. This drop is speculated to be caused by issues like harassment and unhealthy work environment however as you can see from this article

 [Girls Who Code CEO Tarika Barrett on tech’s gender gap — Quartz (qz.com)](https://qz.com/2097941/girls-who-code-ceo-tarika-barrett-on-techs-gender-gap/) 

 Tesla has been exposed for the same issues and yet it seems not fazed at all. I like Blizzard as a stock since they have Diablo IV and Overwatch II coming as well as talks from the CEO  Bobby Kotick for a player 1 metaverse coming 

 [Activision Blizzard CEO Says A Ready Player One-Like Metaverse Is Coming - GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-says-a-ready-player-one-like-metaverse-is-coming/1100-6490762/) 

I like to think that a WoW metaverse is highly possible in the up coming years as the virtual gaming/life idea progresses. Also the fact that about 80+% of the stock is held by institutional investors seems to make it pretty reliable. Forecast seems to place the stock anywhere from 90-130$ which wont make anyone rich overnight but pretty good return if it plays out well...

And im just wondering if anyone has any other news that they would like to share, I put all my life-savings into this stock when it was trading at 62$.",1638843900.0

These notes seem to come out weekly, so it's not a conspiracy... probably. I'm not even qualified to buy this stuff. There's probably someone here who can make this all sound normal / tell me who's making money from this product and what their angle is. My first guess was that Tesla shorts were the ones paying out the interest, and essentially borrowing the buyer's principle to finance their position, but I don't know. My conspiracy-brain was reading this as an ABACUS-style situation, but instead of housing, it's Tesla. Someone here might know, maybe.

14808,Unusual Deep ITM Calls on Guess?,rahfg6,[removed],1638823981.0
14809,Top BioTech stocks worth watching based on indirect performance indicators,rahe97,"For the past year and a half, there has been a lot of focus on the biotech sector. Since the COVID-19 has entered our everyday lives, billions of people around the planet hoped for a vaccine, and fortunately, several effective vaccines were developed. That's why the spotlight for biotech investors (and investors from other segments later too) has been on companies that have developed effective vaccines and treatments.

For example, the shares of Moderna, previously known only to the investors that followed the biotech sector closely, are up more than 1300% since the beginning of the pandemic:

https://preview.redd.it/vvpsr7e9iz381.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=894f18787403ae1bad617e27354205f2fd59a1bb

Besides the stocks engaged in COVID treatments, there are many more biotech stocks to look at, and my today's analysis will cover the full sector and main players in it over the past month (in total, there are **\~6600 biotech** companies in the United States).

&#x200B;

To begin with, let's see which stocks from the biotech sector got the biggest amount of **traffic to their website** over the past quarter:

**1. Ocugen Inc. (**[**$OCGN**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ocgn)**)** \- a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on developing gene therapies to cure blindness diseases.

[website traffic](https://preview.redd.it/hmvud38biz381.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd9f481e1ae3a4a4d0d647f3e3a56ff985f87a9)

Ocugen has more than quadrupled investors' money this year thanks to interest in the COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin, let's see if this stock will bring us more:

https://preview.redd.it/qchbo1ediz381.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b09e8e1668f7d9a3bd23e89a712e99121dc7cf5

**2. CRISPR Therapeutics AG (**[**$CRSP**](https://contora.ai/ticker/crsp)**)** \- a gene-editing company, focuses on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious human diseases. The company develops its products using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), a gene-editing technology that allows for precise directed changes to genomic DNA.

[website traffic](https://preview.redd.it/tpxf0rufiz381.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6414623cb740713d3a22916d33c5b8881c252b6)

Crispr was the first public company to emerge based on the gene-editing technology called CRISPR-CAS9. However, good science doesn’t always make for a great company. In 2021, $CRSP stock is having a tough time turning innovation into worthwhile drugs, and investors are out of patience (since the beginning of 2021, $CRSP stock is down over 40% - shares are at $80 and the company has a market capitalization of $6B):

https://preview.redd.it/s0wkllzhiz381.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eea2963ff91d849786575fb50b7fb754ef20135

**3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (**[**$VRTX**](https://contora.ai/ticker/vrtx)**) -** the company engages in developing and commercializing therapies for treating cystic fibrosis.

[website traffic](https://preview.redd.it/jw4sj0ojiz381.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e40c04477ad8a4b4a2f67f0843be04d0ee35fcc)

This stock has also given lots of headaches to the investors over the past year - investors worry that Vertex is struggling to expand beyond its core portfolio of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments. However, $VRTX has delivered an excellent performance during the Q3  - revenue increased by 29% to $1.98 billion from the year-ago period while net income jumped 28% to $852 million. Will this stock be able to climb out?

Despite the drop in the price of shares of $CRSP and $VRTX, investors still consider these stocks are worth buying, and as you can see from the website's traffic data, they still attract the attention of thousands of people with their investigations and treatments.

&#x200B;

The second perspective - **the number of employees**. I've been collecting employees data from Linkedin, and then aggregated the collected data in a historical perspective and got the top 3 companies with the most dynamic employees growth over the past month:

**1. Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (**[**$ITCI**](https://contora.ai/ticker/itci)**)** \- a biopharmaceutical company, develops novel drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurologic diseases, and other disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) in the United States.

[headcount](https://preview.redd.it/ejd6pogniz381.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=6edecf244d95bf672a2fc28aafffe95372ee84df)

Btw, $ITCI published their Q3 financial report on November 9th and showed great figures - total revenues in Q3 grew to $22.2 million compared to $7.4 million of total revenues in the third quarter of 2020, CAPLYTAs third quarter net product revenues reached $21.6 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $7.4 million in the same period last year. This stock is definitely worth keeping an eye on!

**2.** **Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (**[**$MRTX**](https://contora.ai/ticker/mrtx)**)** \- a clinical-stage oncology company, develops product candidates to address the genetic and immunological promoters of cancer in the United States.

[headcount](https://preview.redd.it/5xtl30zqiz381.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6073c92daa13b8f3e7afc52aee95b27203e876)

These guys are actively working on new drugs and treatments - on November 17th, $MRTX announced that it has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the Company's synthetic lethal PRMT5 inhibitor, MRTX1719, for the treatment of methylthioadenosine phosphoylase (*MTAP*)-deleted cancers.

**3.** **Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (**[**$TPTX**](https://contora.ai/ticker/tptx)**)** \- a clinical-stage precision oncology biopharmaceutical company, engages in designing and developing therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer.

[headcount](https://preview.redd.it/cxuo2xrsiz381.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebef368827e5783a0e8dafec016287e0f2d3d405)

The $TPTX keep setting anti-records for their stock price - now it's a new 12-month low at $37.10 and they have already fallen out of favor with hedge funds. Nevertheless, they've been actively hiring new employees over the past month, will there be a boost?  

I don't have clear statistical evidence that the growth of employees affects the stock price on hand, but following the usual logic - if the company is actively hiring more staff, then it is empowering and developing, which may affect the stock's price in the future.

&#x200B;

And the cherry on the top - let's take a look at the **most discussed biotech stocks on Twitter** over the past week to be in the middle of crossfire!

**1. iSpecimen Inc. (**[**$ISPC**](https://contora.ai/ticker/ISPC)**)** \- provides technology that connects life science researchers who need human biofluids, tissues, and living cells for their research with biospecimens available in healthcare provider organizations worldwide.

[twitter discussions](https://preview.redd.it/vsw5i9zuiz381.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=7abc2b2558d945b5d2f8dac19d159769943d89f7)

iSpecimen stock was on the move since Monday after announcing partnerships with the U.S. Government and private researchers for Covid-19 research. After it, more than 56 million shares of $ISPC stock have been traded (just to let you go deep into the numbers, the company’s daily average trading volume is about 65K shares. And as a result, the stock price has doubled within a couple of days:

https://preview.redd.it/3yfwrqixiz381.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=7083c70400741f675533736bfcabc586aeb73698

**2. Adagio Therapeutics, Inc. (**[**$ADGI**](https://contora.ai/ticker/adgi)**)** \- a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of antibody-based solutions for infectious diseases in the United States.

https://preview.redd.it/sgw5bnwziz381.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=06dfe36dade1d0ad97de73d40efb348304971419

Biotech stocks diverged Tuesday with Adagio Therapeutics on the rise again on the potential for its next-generation antibody to target Covid's omicron variant, and Adagio stock rocketed:

In the public tendering process the following manufacturers are offering their fighters:

Boeing (F/A 18 Super Hornet & Growler)

Lockheed Martin (F-35 Lightning II)

Dassault (Rafale)

Eurofighter (Typhoon)

Saab (JAS 39 Gripen E)

A Consortium of Aviation & Military specialists are handling the public tender process and according to media sources they are proposing the Lockheed Martin F-35 as the new pick. This would be the 3rd largest acquisition of F-35:s in Europe after the UK and Italy. The acquisition budget is around 11 Billion $ and the lifetime budget of the planes is estimated around 25-50 Billion $.

According to the sources, the Finnish government will make a decision regarding the acquisition within the following 10 days. The Expert's have recommended the government to buy the F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. Last time when the Hornet acquisition was made, the government chose according to the recommendation of the experts.

Now here’s the narrative…

DDR5 is the next evolution of dynamic RAM, and all the investment analysts are super smart and have built reliable models of how system builders slowly transition from one memory standard to the next.  In fact you can find many articles from the past 6 months about how the cyclical DRAM market has entered a slower phase and the combination of inventory and production ramp-up time means we can expect slower growth from chip makers that are heavily DRAM makers. Like Micron.  That’s the sole reason why Micron (PE 14) has not followed Nvidia (PE 114), AMD (PE 47), Broadcom (PE 42), Applied Materials (PE 27), Qualcomm (PE 23) into much higher valuations.

But now there’s a nasty new version of an exploit called RowHammer that hackers can use to disrupt or steal from DDR4 systems, which is most of the worlds current PC and Unix systems.

DDR5 is naturally more resistant to RowHammer.  Intel and AMD motherboards are already scheduled to ship in 2022 with DDR5 support, so the engineering work is done.  The Rowhammer exploit increases the urgency to upgrade systems and will thus shift the demand curve ahead of what the analysts have in their models.

Now DDR5 makers like Micron, instead of being seen as in a more slow-growth phase of their industry compared to other chip makers, will quickly be recognized to be in high-growth phase, maybe emergency high-growth if a couple Rowhammer exploitations get publicized.

Edit:  I know I misspelled RowHammer in the title.  Turns out you can't edit the title.  Total autist here, you're prolly best off ignoring everything I say.",1638819824.0

14889,$BB BlackBerry 🍇 is ready to launch - List of upcoming catalysts!,rafgfj,"Hi Everyone 🐵 - Here is why I'm bullish on BlackBerry's future both short term and longer term.

BlackBerry has so many upcoming catalysts that will make your **TENDIES PRINT** 🐔 💦 - QNX, Amazon Ivy, Billion Dollar Patent Sale/Partnership, Cyber Security, Internet of Things (IoT) ect... but there are other also things happening to drive each and every one of Blackberry's products forward - products that we don't even think about. So here is a bit of a product list with a sprinkling of speculation!

1. **QNX and QNX Hypervisor** \- QNX is in 195m cars, but the Hypervisor is more recent. All the new deals are not just buying QNX RTOS, but they are running the Hypervisor and multiple VM's on high performance chips. This means that the dollar per car will increase by at least 4 - 5 times current values of just QNX.
2. **BlackBerry IVY** \- When it launches there will be a whole new revenue stream for Blackberry, but it's going to be subscription based meaning month after month revenue! Great for changing stock analyst's opinions.
3. **BlackBerry Jarvis** \- Analyses software in embedded systems for vulnerabilities and regulatory compliance - Think about designing software for an EV and trying to get Government compliance for autonomous vehicle driving. Any tool to speed the process is going to do well it the race to build EV's
4. **BlackBerry Alert and ATHOC** are both crisis management and communication software that are becoming mission critical these days in a world of cyber attacks and global warming. Nothing but steady growth for these products.
5. **BlackBerry Radar** is global logistics and asset tracking solution. Covid blew that industry up! People want to know where their shit is!
6. **BlackBerry Cyber Security** \- AI (*Artificial intelligence*) integrated into their end points, into their authentication, and their new hardware, as well as having monitoring services and support.... Because Cyber incidents might not go away for a little while!

As a reminder, the market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \~$5 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $45 Billion, $PANW at $49 Billion and $ZS at $38 Billion as of December 2021.

**Overall Thoughts:**

BlackBerry is laying the foundation for a very successful next few years and I think the share price will reach $50+ over the next 2-3 of years from EV's alone, especially as the security risks become evermore publicized. The investing market as a whole simply is not yet aware and educated enough of the benefits BlackBerry will bring and can see no further than past performance and what revenue they are currently generating or will generate in the next couple of quarters, in addition to being biased by BlackBerry's uninspiring performance over the last months. This is fine, understandable even, but it is going to leave a lot of people kicking themselves when they didn't get BlackBerry for below $15 per share. Blackberry has got a lot of stuff going on, but every industry they are in is poised to explode in growth over the next 5 years!

**BlackBerry's weekly chart is approaching the breakout point and ready to explode and squeeze higher. Any good news should be bullish for the stock price!** 🚀🌕💎

**Patent Sale/Partnership is going to be announced anytime between now and earnings on December 16th or 20th or 21st (different websites have different dates). Google bought the entire Motorola company for $12.5 Billion specifically for their patents.**

**PAPA CHEN said on the last earnings conference call that the price is finalized and there is an 80% chance of closing before end of the quarter/year. Details were a big upfront payment + 7 years of revenue steam/royalties.**

**Rumors from earlier this year from credible new organizations speculated that Facebook and/or a group of entities is the buyer for BlackBerry's patent portfolio.**

**There was also interesting theories that a Facebook + BlackBerry partnership could be made where ""BlackBerry Secure"" could help bring WhatsApp to the Enterprise. Salesforce bought out Slack a while back for similar goals and integration. This could potentially help Facebook compete with Slack and Microsoft Teams as an Enterprise communications platform.**

14910,Year End Market Sentiment,raekls,"I just wanna share my opinion here and help you save money:

* Quarter end balancing will last till the very end of Dec, since stock went up so much and all P/E are looking ridiculous, funds will be selling to balance their portfolio in order to maintain agreed asset ratio.
* Fed tapering dries up free money in the market slowly, borrowing is become more expensive quietly. It's not like a margin call but as you can see, all the insane valued stocks fell around 50% compare to ATH. Because  very soon everyone cannot play on free money anymore, they are preparing in advance. Also company without good balance sheet will take a hit, because they mostly operate on borrowed free money which will be no more.
* Inflation will be transitory until the sun explodes, so overall direction is to find ""Safe Asset"". As you can see, the selling in digital corns, in high valuation stocks, the rise in strong cash holders like APPL and retails with full pricing power, also in housing market, BTW paper gold and silver are fake, unless you buy real.
* The China shit, the king will keep it organized, but it is for his people, I do not think he cares about oversee investors and foreign HF buying his puppets' bonds. The value is not too large for the market, but it is something everyone will watch out for. (and there's butterfly effects, could be 2008).

Here's my pitch: the Russ 2000 has taken a beating the last month due to the Omicron variant and the assumption that small cap companies would have a harder time withstanding shutdowns or COVID related closures than large cap. Dave and Busters is down 17% in that time frame.

Here's what they didn't figure out; the public doesn't really care about the Omicron variant. The US has a decent vax rate and taken together with antibodies, nearly 92% of the country has some form of immunity. Omicron searches on google trends are down big from a few weeks ago. People don't care. Not to get political, but it's likely the media isn't pushing Omicron as much because Biden's ratings are not hot and any further pressure on him won't help. Similarly, with a predicted red wave in 2022, the Dems don't want to put any more restrictions on business. So why is PLAY down? I think it overcorrected.

15010,DOORDASH IS TRASH. NOTHING BUT PUTS. $DASH,rac8ih,"**INTRO**

Let me start off with, this company that connects people who want food, to people who will get it for them have a $54 BILLION MARKET CAP. Let that sink in for a minute....

**TLDR;**

DoorDash is highly overvalued. Has many issues. Not well baked company. Tech is poor. Their dasher churn is high. There is constant need for customer support for dashers when things should be automated. The only thing they have is market share. If someone develops something better, they will disappear. I'm currently not holding any positions but I'm about to place as many puts on $DASH as possible.  Will update when I do.

**UPDATE:**

**MAY 20, 2022 $100p. That is my position. Will roll it further out if need be.** 

**The DD:**

Now, when Wendys isn't making enough and the dumpster is out of clients, your next move is Uber or Doordash. Because I drive an old pile of shit cause my RH account is more up and down than a stripper, Doordash was my only option.

I decided to do DoorDash to make some extra cash (for more OTM calls), my RH account was recently blown up (cause I'm really smaert), and my clients are slow to pay.

I have a friend that does it as well and he makes good money with his main job but wanted an extra gig to pull in some cash so I learned all the tricks and tips from him since he did it for over a year now.

**My experience**

Alright so we got all that BS off the table now here is my experience as well as talking to other ""Dashers"" online and in person to make sure this isn't just me.

There are expected things like, poor GPS mapping to new developments, and glitches that come up and I write those off. Tech can only go so far. If you can't look at addresses in a neighborhood and figure it out or call the customer, you're just dumb.

My deliveries generally went okay. I even delivered to a strip club a couple times. So the perks to the job are there. Very perky and some not so much.

Here is what I saw when they didn't go well:

1. Orders picked up by the customer, the previous dasher didn't handle it properly, I get assigned. Or previous dasher picked up and delivered it but some how it didn't close out, so I got assigned. I drive there, only to find this out. I then have to spend 10-15 minutes contacting support to get the task cancelled, and I get half pay. This was so common it was happening almost nightly. Let's say it was a $10 task, I'd get $5. DoorDash eats that. I've probably made $50 or more in a week from this kind of stuff. Worse yet, I've talked to probably 100 others, and all have the same story. All over the US. I have no doubt DoorDash is bleeding cash. Cash that could easily not be lost. Not to mention the added customer service cost of handling these issues. If they pay me $5 for an order they messed up, plus I took customer services time of 10 minutes, multiply that x 1000 times a day and you get a lot of bleeding. 1000 times is probably a low number too.

The simple task of adding a button in DoorDash that would say, has this been picked up? Dasher hit's yes, the restaurant confirms with a popup on their screen, and no customer service needs to be involved. Dasher gets half pay and moves on to the next task. How simple.

Or maybe prevent the picking up issue or closing out issue in the first place. But ya know burning cash is fun.

2. Better task management. Say I get an order for Walgreens. I go there and pick stuff up, then I get an order for Taco Bell while I'm at Walgreens. Logic would say, pick up the Walgreens, then go to Taco Bell and pick that up. THEN deliver Taco bell first, then Walgreens. Why? Unless Walgreens has something like hot food, which they don't, then the food should take priority. This is why when you order DoorDash and you get cold food, there is a good chance the dasher sucks but also a good chance that an order from some place else took priority over yours. First come, first serve.

3. Rating customers. Dashers have a rating and if you want to stay a dasher, you need to perform. Problem is, some customers suck. Now, I expect people to suck, cause most people do. That doesn't bother me. What does is the same people like to order food with no tip. You'll say, ""just decline those orders."" True, you can. But the the problem is all the other dashers might not decline it and it keeps the delivery fee way lower than it should be but also allows customers to do whatever they want in a sense. There is no repercussions. Dashers cannot set a poor delivery rating of the customer. Or a big one, and this goes to the next point, difficult to deliver to houses. This could be resorts, large homes in the country, or special delivery requests not specified in the app but they have it when you get there. More on this in the #6 point.

4. The task assignment request window is truly designed to screw dashers. The window shows a small window where you're going. Best thing you can go off of is the mileage, which helps. But lets say you don't want to deliver to certain areas because you know they suck to deliver to, well you can't really see that. You an but it's tiny. In a perfect world, you'd see a large map of your traveling area, customer address, pickup location, and any special requests. The amount of times this screwed me is beyond me.

5. Walmart orders. Yeah, would recommend to say no to these. They generally suck and have the least amount of pay. Unless they bulk up the orders, so you pickup order for 10 customers. That's not terrible. Problem is, the app bulks them together and doesn't really give two shits if it makes sense distance wise or not. I did one the other night. Was supposedly 30 miles round trip. I probably did 40-50 miles. Minor. But the places it bulked the orders to was illogical. I was all over.

Also with Walmart orders, you have to scan the package when you get it. Then when you get to the customer, you have to scan the package, again. And send a text or call to the customer. And take a photo of the delivery location. And leave a note... cause why the f not? It's a lot of wasted time. I'm sure it was per Walmart requirements but it's such a hassle it's not even worth doing it. Takes an extra few minutes, multiply that times multiple orders and it's a massive time suck. Even if I write, ""package at door"" for the text and the message, I still lose at least a minute that would otherwise be in and out. Should just be, scan package at pickup, at drop off, and a photo of the delivery location. THAT'S IT.

6. Other BS. Special requests like, I get to a house, that is massive, with a stupid long driveway. First, they don't want delivery vehicles in their driveway, alright fine. It's not mentioned in the app though. They have a sign at their driveway. Then I get to the door. ""Please deliver to the back of the house."" The house is a cluster F of path ways and nothing at this place has a straight path way to the back of the house. I ended up delivering to their garage door as the Fedex guy did cause it's a bunch of bull to have all these request, no mention of it in the app and no additional tip to cover it. This was of course a Walmart order for $3.00! I could get a few FD's for that... am I right?

Sad part is, this is fairly common with Walmart orders. Not for just me but others. Which is another reason to stay away from Walmart orders. But even food orders, if you don't put in these special requests, dashers get screwed and then end up just putting your stuff where ever. Not a shock there is dasher churn, and I would bet its on issues like this. This goes back to a customer rating system. If Dashers saw this, they'd decline these orders, and the customer would have to pay more. Which is only fair. Shit Fedex/UPS/USPS should charge more for these places too if they could.

Houses in the country, with driveways that are longer than most city blocks... this more of a rant on this one. I live in the country. My house has a turn around in the driveway, it's not terribly long. Why, cause I have to plow that shit and I don't have all day to f around with that. Also why do I need a massively long driveway? The amount of country houses with driveways that zig zag that could just... I don't know... go straight to the friggin house, is beyond me. It's such a waste of everything. Sorry my logical brain breaks when I see this stuff. It's less of a $DASH issue but still an issue.

Resorts. How I hate them. Some let you go to the customers room. Some don't. Some won't let you past the gate. Customers complain, ""why can't you come to me?"" Cause security won't let me. If you want to waste a lot of time, resorts will be your best friend. I stay far away from them. This is a challenge but DoorDash needs to work with resorts to improve this. Either set it up to drop off at the lobbys by default or with security. Or charge more for specific spots with the additional wait time. I don't know for sure. It's a hell of a hassle though. 10/10 would not recommend resorts.

Why is the last two a DoorDash issue? The longer it takes for Dashers to handle deliveries, the longer it takes to get more out. With high dasher churn rates, there are only so many around to move the orders. If dashers don't get the additional pay to deal with the hassle, they won't deliver there or they will quit. Leading to more churn. Leading to increased delivery costs.

One last thing on the country stuff, Delivering outside the delivery area is bogus. Shouldn't even be possible. Yet it is some how.

7. App issues. Common. GPS breaks. Can't scan packages. Full out app being down (has happened recently.) For $54 billion market cap, I expect a lot more. I know even facebook (shit company as well but that's another story) has outages, though they are much less common. Support, is good, but it's kind of scattered. If you asked me at face value, this app looks and operates like a startup 2-3 years in. Not a publicly traded company with a $54 billon dollar market cap.

&#x200B;

**Now you'll say, ""but dude, this is pretty much your experience and other's you've talked to. This doesn't mean much.""**

I would normally agree. Here is the hang up. We know DoorDash is burning cash before I even started doing this. If you don't, go read the financials.

Some, if not many, would say at an unsustainable rate. 10Ks and all the financial data in the world is one thing, but as I learned from many great people in my life, you gotta get in the trenches to really know what is going on. I believe Jack Welch was big on this (CEO of GE when it was really good, for those of you who don't know.) I got in the trenches. DoorDash in my opinion isn't far from a shitshow. Which would be fine if it was a startup, not publicly traded, with only a few years under it's belt. But none of that is the case here. They should have these issues figured out by now. They should not be burning as much cash. Yet here we are.

I can post all the financial data in the world but all the Bulls will say, ""Nah, you're wrong."" So it's not worth it. I call myself a bull, I don't like betting against things cause you normally lose. This is long game, puts all day for me. LEAP puts. I do not see DoorDash sustaining this level of market share, cap, or anything long term. Their Dashpass is not a method to sustain things. Just a crutch that eventually customers will walk away from as their isn't enough incentive to keep giving them $9.99 a month unless you get food everyday. Amazon Prime makes sense for all the things you get. And I don't even have Amazon Prime or shares.

Arguments to them branching out and becoming more of an Ecommerce platform is just dumb. They barely have this area of things under control. It's like Shopify saying they are gonna branch out in to DoorDash's terrority. Shopify is great, but they have no business in the food delivery business. Or on-demand courier, however you see DoorDash.

Seriously, UberEats, hit me up, I'll build a team to dominate DoorDash in a year or less. It's not hard to see DoorDash's flaws here. And unless they fix them soon, competition can and will take their market share.

&#x200B;

**Best thing I can say to anyone ordering on Doordash. Unless you like cold food, then ignore this.**

1. Make sure your address is really easy to spot. House numbers can be seen day or night no issue. Put them on a mailbox (if you don't have those community boxes) and on the house. The bigger and more obvious the better.
2. If it's night time, turn on your outside light. Preferably one that lights up by your house numbers.
3. If it's an apartment, specify the name of the apartment complex in the address line 2 or in the order notes. Makes a world of a difference. Also if you're in an apartment complex that is multiple buildings but has the same address number, try to explain which building it is. I had one the other day, they said the building facing the woods, Boom, I got their way faster. Simple shit folks.
4. Answer your phone or texts when you place an order. The amount of times I needed to call a customer because their place was a pain to find or an order issue, but got no response was pretty high.
5. Tip. Common sense here. $2.50 to send your Taco Bell to your apartment on the 3rd floor and have to deal with security is not worth it. Even if we're less than a mile from Taco Bell.

&#x200B;

**Outro**

I'll probably stop doing DoorDash soon. It was a good experiment to see how it works and the flaws.  Cash wasn't terrible once I figured out what to avoid and be the most profitable possible.

Not to mention all the other things I learned, how badly short staffed everything is. How many companies say they are paying more but many of the franchise locations are not (no wonder you can't get anyone at Mcdonald's for $11/hr when the place across the street is paying $15 for the same job.) Still plenty of places paying more but can't find the workers.

How the food is made... ya I won't ever eat fast food again.

Talking to the people and understanding their lives and issues. Whether it was other DoorDashers in the field or online, or those making the food. Best question I got from a manager at one of the restaurants, **""Dude, is what you're doing even profitable?""** I answered reasonably but afterwards I was thinking... nah I do this for charity. It is profitable, but it is hit or miss. Some nights are awesome. Some are terrible. Many of the issue nights were related to the app being trash. Overall it's not the worst. There again though, at $54 billion market cap, I shouldn't have these app issues.

Seeing the common customers, there tends to be a demographic that are the main users of DoorDash, at least in all the discussions I've had with others on it and from what I've seen.

The most interesting to me is the nightly switch between the top places to pick up. One night Taco bell, then Mcdonalds, then KFC. Was like everyone was programmed to order from one place or the other. I'm sure incentives played into it from DoorDash or some ad campaign.

I haven't made my positions yet in DoorDash ($DASH) but I will this week. Planning on Leaps. Nothing but a PUTs position. Will update at the top what my positions are when the time comes.

&#x200B;

Last... I'm not an investment advisor. Just some guy that did DoorDash for awhile and doesn't believe the company is worth what it is. Do your own research. This isn't advice.",1638810726.0

I'm a south east asian and I want to share about why I'm buying puts on Grab

I am not a financial expert and it has been quite hard to find information but what I found

1. Their market cap/yearly revenue is currently around 45x, with no revenue growth in Q3. The typical rule of thumb for high-growth is 30x yearly revenue
2. Short runway - their burn rate is 988mil/quarter & their cash is estimated around 7billion post-ipo (ipo of 4.5 billliion)
3. Competition - in Indonesia - their main market, they are currently being ravaged by Shopee (Amazon on steroid) for food delivery and by Gojek for rides
4. Hybrid work model is adopted widely in Singapore (one of their main market) 

Hence, their current situation is not good and I don't think there's much growth either

With number 1 alone, I bet their stock will go down to around $5 or $6 in 2 weeks

My position is 17 Dec $8p",1638803503.0

15119,Gitlab ($GTLB) Puts--A Very Convincing Play,ra99fc,"I've largely avoided DD after a bit of a disaster 10 months ago where I said buy Chegg puts when it was at 105...and then it rocketed. But now Chegg is at 28...ffs. And then, I said to buy Unity when it was dipping to 100...and then it bled to 80 before rocketing to 200 some months later. Timing is everything, though, so I definitely deserved the hate DM's.

&#x200B;

In any case, I feel very strongly about this play, and wanted to see if y'all agree.

Gitlab, $GTLB, operates off the freemium model where free users are converted to paying customers. In June of this year, less than 1% of its customers actually paid for their services.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6iikdt4dox381.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c7d3295ba26931abd28123deab78ffc4484684

Though revenue has grown year-over-year by by 87%, their actual cash flow declined from -$149 million in fiscal 2020, to -$229 million in fiscal 2021. They are bleeding money, and the IPO was essentially a way to prevent themselves from going bankrupt.

&#x200B;

This could be okay, so long as the company is gaining steady footing in the industry. However, it is competing with the likes of Microsoft's GitHub. Microsoft can afford to offer GitHub's services for much cheaper to capture the market share, and indeed after their acquisition, the price of GitHub's lowest price plan nearly halved, from $9/month to $4/month.

Subscriptions is the ONLY way Gitlab makes money, and their dwindling market share is going to be reflected.

&#x200B;

Next up, how about their valuation?

Uhhh.....**12.5 billion**, at the time of this post.

&#x200B;

Even at a valuation of $8 billion, they would have to triple their current market share, reverse the downward trend in profits, and grow revenue by over 17x.

Furthermore, from f2020-f2021, their R&D costs increased by 79%. In the 6 months ending last July? It only increased 13%. It is hard to innovate and compete with the likes of Microsoft and Oracle when you are spending fractions of what they are on developing new products and attracting customers.

&#x200B;

The stock is wildly overvalued, and I feel strongly that their first earnings call today after hours will bring a hard-about.

Put premiums are sadly through the roof, but if it's a large enough move, ITM should be safe.

&#x200B;

Risks:

I've been wrong on timing before. But I honestly do not see how this could rocket given that they bleed money profusely, and lose market share to boot. The valuation is so ridiculous! But, this is their first earnings call, so it's unknown territory

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

This company is wildly overvalued,  bleeding money, and steadily losing market share to Microsoft's GitHub. The first earnings call today after hours should reflect this.

Put premiums and IV are skyrocketing, to the point where 12/17 strikes might not even be worth it. Nonetheless, ITM should be safe.

YOLO:

12/17 60P for \~$170

12/17 80P for \~$650

&#x200B;

Safe(r):

1/21 85P for \~$1100",1638803028.0

15235,$HIMX: An opportunity too big to dismiss,ra4z3n,"$HIMX is a semiconductor company which focuses on providing imaging solutions for all sorts of companies and is based in Taiwan.

HIMX is probably one of the most undevalued stocks on the market right now. For the last quarter the company announced a revenue of 420 million (nice) and an EPS of 0,80$ (beat by 0,23$). 

With a market cap of 1,7 Billion and a P/E ratio of 4,5 the stock just seems perversly undervalued. 

&#x200B;

[$HIMX quarterly revenue](https://preview.redd.it/kthisfchhw381.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=f555388166f79b34e523c13e0db309a4d593b930)

The earnings were so insane, that for the first time in three years, the company paid out a dividend of 0,27$/share. 

The next dividend payout is expected to contain 0,5$ to 1$ per share which would be a yield of 5-10%. 

The company is expected to keep outperforming and increasing their revenues and earnings in the next few quarters which could definitely serve as a major catalyst. Even the Wallstreet ""analysts"" have a Price Target of 17$. 

# TLDR

$HIMX is massively undervalued and the only thing holding it back from landing on Mars is the lack of exposure. 

With it's constant earnings growth and a massive dividend payout scheduled next year, I expect the  price to reach at least 20$ in 2022. (A short interest of 21% could probably even spice up the price increase)

I'm in with all I got (It ain't much but it's honest work) and I hope to see you again on Jupiter.

15301,"New Silicon - SSB - Lithium Metal Battery - Announcements - Microvast ($MVST) Presentation, Dr Wenjun Mattis CTO Microvast November 25th Transcript - New Pack, Module and Cell Technology & Safety Testing",r9zd8l,"As you can see in the transcript and slides below Microvast has released a significant amount of new information on upcoming products (Silicon and Solid State Batteries for example).

We know that also in the Q3 earnings call, CEO Wu told us that two new products will be announced in Q1, but this is a lot more information on those released for the first time.

This presentation below is updates from a IRSEC (International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference) where the Chief Technology Officer Dr,. Wenjuan Mattis presented a wealth of new information.

I'll leave it all here for you in the detail below, but for some of you that don't want to read and look at the detail that I put together in order to share this with you, here are five of the top things:

1. **Two New Batteries in Q1 2022**Microvast is launching two new batteries starting in Q1 (as per CEO Wu on last quarterly call), and they will be released by the next earnings call.  In the presentation from Mattis talked about two key upcoming batteries, the one that would be launched nearest term, was a Silicon based battery, and she talks about this extensively and in the Q&A goes into some pretty scientific big brain things, which sound crazy to me.  The battery being launched in Q1 2021 is also shown on several slides, and this battery is the one that won them the R&D 100 award, and it will have silicon carbon components, the polyaramid separator, the full concentration gradient cathode, the non-flammable electrolytes with 30% higher energy density then the competition.
2. **Solid State Battery Development and Plans**SSB - Microvast through this presentation really embellished their plans and development of a Solid State Battery, Lithium Metal Battery, and that this has been a project since 2015 of Microvast, they have 12 patents in this area, and that they are working with Dr Amine of Argonne National Labs on this as well.
3. **Competitive Benchmarking**Even the existing batteries since 2019 NMC 2 beats out competition greatly - one slide with side to side comparison of the new battery to the leading EV battery right now, and we are talking 20% greater range (370 miles vs 300), 3X faster charging  (12 minutes vs 30 mins), 3X lifespan (3,000 cycles vs 1,000 cycles, and 4X lifetime mileage (1 million miles vs 270K)
4. **100% Polyaramid Separator**Only Microvast has the knowhow and patents to make this, it is made of the same stuff that bullet proof vests are, and its one of the key components that make Microvast batteries safety unparamount.  Dr Wenjuan explains this in great detail throughout the presentation with third party accredited testing laid out in explicit detail in several slides (including one with pictures of the cells burning).  They also developed a non-flammable electrolyte that will not burn in its liquid or gas state.
5. **Global Innovation Center (R&D Facility Just announced in Orlando, FL)**Their newly announced Global Innovation Center in Orlando FL, an R&D Facility, they will have eight acres 75,000 square feet, over 250 parking spots and over 100 offices.  They already have over 550 patents, and are working in many great areas from the component to the cell to the module to the pack level (They are fully vertically integrated so can control all levels of the battery, and how they interact with eachother and use AI simulations which they show in one slide, and live testing).  Dr Wenjuan invites attendees to come check out the facility so they can discuss the electrification of the world.

Here is the full transcript and all the slides (which have extensive new and detailed information themselves).    There is a lot here, but some real gold for people who want to dig since much of this is all new information.

(Pre-slide introduction Wenjuan) You're welcome. Yeah, let me just can just start screen sharing. Also Dr amine you you may need to. Okay good thinking

&#x200B;

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  00:20

(Slide 1 - title slide)

everyone see my screen at the full screen mode? We can see it. Yes. All right, good. Hey, good morning. Good afternoon everyone, Wenjuan here, I have been working on the development of lithium ion battery technology for over 16 years. I hold 22 papers 81 patents, at Microvast I'm responsible for the development of battery materials, cells module and pack from r&d to production.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  01:04

(Slide 2 - Microvast at a glance)

Thank you, (Dr. Amin) for your introduction and giving me the opportunity to speak at IRSEC 21. It's my great pleasure to talk today about Microvast. And how we work to enable is a competent high energy electric vehicle batteries and mitigate it to safety. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask you \*please refrain from using or posting any information share today without our permission\*. Firstly, to the glance of the company microvast was founded in 2006 in Houston, Texas, we dedicated in developing battery technology for electric vehicles has been working on this for over 15 years. And we follow the market establish the r&d production and the business started in China and was then extended into Europe and now in United States. Today, our batteries are integrated in more than 28,000 vehicles that is running in 160 cities, over 19 countries and with those electric vehicles. Altogether, they have traveled over 3.8 billion miles in the last 10 years. Earlier this year, we raised about $820 million dollars and went public on NASDAQ this year, on July the 26th. Microvast is a fully vertically integrated - meaning that we design develop and manufacture a complete battery system starting with battery materials, cells, module and pack including the battery management system, thermal control, high voltage charging box and \*also the charging station\*. We will discuss more in details later.

(Slide 3 - Development of Advanced)

The three underlining battery features Microvast invented the 15 years ago, were fast charging to ensure the mobility, long life maximize the total cost of ownership and the design for safety from the start, given the critical demand for high energy density. those features are foundational to the innovative technologies and the products that we're delivering to the market.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  03:45

# (Slide 4 - Established Global Presence)

https://preview.redd.it/shqjtl85vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f70ee37def2252af3d04cd938ce341ad34966bb

Here I'd like to give you a snapshot of our geographic footprint today. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and have established the factory in Cujo since 2011. We have a three gigawatt hour from the cells to pack production in Cujo totally have about 1.7 million square feet of the production line, including the cathode, the electrolytes, anode, and the separator production. And we established the module pack production facility in Berlin, Germany, and the whole building can hold about six gigawatt hour. Currently we commissioned the to supplying the Europe right now. And earlier this year, we have acquired this existing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee, which is about 45 minutes northwest of Nashville, Tennessee. Here we have 85 acres and over 577,000 square feet of existing building that is being converted into a cell to pack a production line holds the floor for about a 4 gw hour. The Dr. Amin in the beginning of the in the meeting introduced the Microvast as one of the largest cell producer in the United States. This statement is accurate, being an American company building a four gigawatt hour cell to pack line, making microvast the largest US a battery suppliers in the States.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  05:29

# (Slide 5 - US R&D Global Tech Center - Orlando, FL)

https://preview.redd.it/1sjng5n5vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1650d1e4aca3871ce44cb2728dc4c7c37262a00f

And so this was announced publicly, we purchased another existing facility in Orlando, Florida, this will be established as the Global Innovation Center for Microvast. So totally, we have about eight acres 75,000 square feet, over 250 parking spots and over 100 offices and 25,000 square feet of this large working space workshop space that we will establish of from materials to pack development in the States as well. We plan to hire about 150 Researchers yet so this is coming into the city and by the four in the interstate four and very welcome for the attendees of the meetings today come to visit to Microvast we communicate, discuss about the newest technology how to make the high energy density cells and safer cells for the electrification of the world. Not only in commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, but also in the stationary energy storage, including our consumer electronics.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  06:49

&#x200B;

# (Slide 6 - Complete Battery Solutions)

https://preview.redd.it/9cakna36vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=026efc01bc1994ddabfbe41477b33788fdb62396

\- Yeah, so on this page that demonstrates the showing cases for the vehicles and the energy storage that Microvast has delivered to the world. \*What's special about this page is in \*\*every single\*\* of this picture, there are Microvast batteries, we took some of these pictures.\* So, those are examples of the 28,000 EVs that the Microvast has been powering, including 1000 Red double decker and all of the heavy duty AGVs in the Port of Singapore, that that are moving heavy containers. We are also supplying passenger vehicles for \*SAIC\* Shanghai motor, the largest OEM in China and Microvast makes the full concentration gradient cathode material has successfully scaled it up to 600 pounds per year to the rate exercise of 20,000 meters and this material can supply for the passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles including the consumer electronics and the Aramid Separator created and industrialized by Microvast is a great choice for the consumer electronics separator since its thinner than the current separator in the battery that we use in the cell phone and can offer outstanding safety. So we will talk about that later in my slides.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  08:35

# (Slide 7 - Microvast Has Best In Class Battery Cell Tech)

https://preview.redd.it/e4dbb3l6vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dab8673ea73cdd326f8fd7cf3ddd59c63627e791

\- So this slide demonstrates a comparison of our products with our peers, the largest ones in the world. We are uniquely positioned in focusing on the commercial vehicle space where most of our major peers are passenger vehicle focused. Why do we focus on commercial vehicle because of its earlier EV adoption, a broader range of use cases, more stringent performance requirements. The redundancy due to use under the harsher conditions, such as the passenger vehicles operates a couple of hours per day. Well commercial vehicles need to operate eight to 24 hours per day. Therefore, commercial vehicle batteries need to double to quadruple passenger vehicle battery cycle life and to offer faster charging and higher power capabilities. The total cost of ownership is calculated over longer lives so that heightened the customers focus on performance. The technology for commercial vehicle is more difficult, but more profitable. By the way, the commercial vehicle market is massive. So The CV is our prioritized choice with our current capacity. And as a matter of fact I mentioned earlier we are supplying for the passenger vehicles.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  10:13

Microvast offers all the major chemistries on the lithium ion battery markets, including NMC \*SP, LTO. the products on the top three rows that have been in the production as early as 10 years ago. And each of them outperforms their peers. Those are third party tested and market validated both through the customer wins and extends a real world deployment experience. \*The last row is the next generation battery product to come.\* With this product, we won the R&D 100 award together with \*Dr. Amines\* team. This technology has been validated by Argonne National Lab, it can offer 30% higher energy density comparing with the current passenger vehicle technology and the still yet can offer fast charging long cycle life capabilities. So the components as a key to enable this cell product, which we did use higher than 90% nickel for the  material with the full concentration distribution, and also with the aramid separator, non flammable electrolytes and also carefully designed the silicon carbon components that is patented by Argonne National Lab. So those technology won us this r&d 100 award and to draw the attention from the several prestigious OEMs in Europe. Currently, these are being tested in their factory. \*\*We have more products in the pipeline, such as the \*solid state battery, lithium metal battery\* that can reach a higher than 1000 Watt hour per liter energy density, and also 80 degrees Celsius high temperature cells, which is a highly appreciated by a high end BV company for a sports car application. \*\*

https://preview.redd.it/5z8g8ca7vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebef2cd5c564f56add9783811a02906bc19533a7

The next page, like to put these things in perspective, what kind of BV performance can we create with our products. On the right, it listed a general spec of a high end BEV in the market. But if we replace the battery, with Microvast high energy density product that has been in the production since 2019, the NMC-2 that we listed on this page, then this whole car can be fully charged within 30 minutes. And with one full charge, our battery can offer 20% more mileage, and roughly three times of a cycle life with those are parameters together, that can lead to about 1 million miles of lifetime of throughput. This is a cycle four times of a regular EV. But of course we don't need one million miles for a passenger vehicle not yet. \*But that is exactly my point.\* Our batteries are made for more demanding applications and the passenger vehicle commodity batteries cannot meet the lifetime requirements of our commercial vehicle then it would need the multiple replacements that can greatly damage the total cost of ownership.

By immediate question may rise, How could you do it? I would like to summarize our technology success into those three columns. Microvast has the broadest the chemistry, probability of the manipulation all the way into the material level and a whole spectrum of the cell products which have been verified and the benchmarks that are highly differentiating from the end user to the chemistry, we have this complete approach the full customization that can lead to the faster development cycle, higher efficiency and the cheaper development cost at the meantime with a better quality guarantee. And now let's discuss each column in detail. The heart of a BV is a battery pack and all the energy in the battery pack are from the cells. Well, the performance of the cells, fundamentally, depending on battery materials, to build the best highest performance battery, that's what driven Microvast into this vertical integration, just like Apple building microprocessors. Microvast has over one decades of designing and manufacturing expertise in battery components, from the cathode, anode to separator to electrolytes.  We gain an intimate knowledge of how those components would interact with each other and their specific conditions. And this differentiates us from the most of the battery makers who sourced their components from the vendors. But the people may ask well, other battery makers can also make the materials. \*But it's important to note that the cell makers do not have the right to produce the materials, they did not invent or have the license for.\* Well Microvast has invented or licensed the manufactured all of those four key battery materials ensure the unique performance in the cells and that can further lead into the module and the pack product. And with this material technology that can ensure our leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents that are legally protected for \*decades\*. Our success is founded in our deep technology portfolio, which is fully owned and protected by over 550 patents and the 1000s of know hows within the company.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  17:03

Amongst all the battery materials Microvast makes two products that stands out that no one else has in the world, the 100% polyaramid separator and the full concentration grade in the cathode material that I will talk about one by one, the carbon two separator in the markets are mostly made of polyethylene polypropylene, the same material as plastic bags or plastic bottles. Microvast manufacturers one of a kind - the high temperature 100% polyaramid separator that is based on the same material as bulletproof vest. This material has outstanding thermal, mechanical, chemical, and electro chemical stabilities. Polyaramid itself is intrinsically non-flammable, it also does not melt it does not dissolve in any solvent. \*That wouldn't make it extremely difficult to process. But yet Microvast made it into a 10 micrometer thick, several meters wide 1000s of meter long industrial separator products that increase the shrinkage temperature of the PE PP separator from around 150 degrees C to 300 degrees Celsius, that's nearly 600 Fahrenheit\*. But why do we choose the 300 degrees C as the goal as we know the cathode materials, particularly as a high energy density cells is a high nickel and MC which in the fully charged state that's the most unstable most unsafe state, they will start to decompose around the 200 to 230 degrees C and the separator it's only perforates only go into separate the cathode from the anode. But if the separator shrink before the batteries being disabled, then the massive internal shortage could happen and several accidents have happened due to that such as the 787 the recent explosion of the stationary energy storage in Beijing China and also suspected to be as a recall main cause of the GM battery and also the Note Seven. Well we when we have the separator designed we wanted a separator to over last the cathode material if it can hold about 300 degrees C. So the cathode the material would start to decompose and the separator holding its \*portrayed\* and After most of the electrical energy has been released by the chemical energy, the thermal energy, the separator would now be finished at his task of the preventing the massive shortage. And beyond that, the we also have the thermal control the BMS in place to have the whole system have the redundancy of a safety design, so that we also will briefly mentioned later on. But while the temperature rises, the cell could, the electrolytes, it would evaporate, the internal pressure in the cells would increase, the cells could break open. And if at the time, the flammable gas rushed out of the cells, meeting the high temperature high voltage, that could cause explosion. Therefore, that's why we designed this nonflammable electrolytes itself can stay nonflammable in its liquid phase, including the gas phase. So with this design, we aim to increase the safety margin. But still yet it does not solve all the problems because of it's a decomposed product. Well, at this high temperature high voltage reaction, the product could still be flammable. Our goal is to increase its safety margin, the same reason for the aramid the separator and the full concentration gradient cathode material.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  21:36

So another product Microvast produces this are this F CT cathode. So this Cathode material offers all the energy in the lithium ion battery, and also takes more than 50% of the cost in the battery. So Microvast is the only one in the world who can produce F CT Cathode material in the industrial scale. In this illustration, the F CT material differentiates from all the other homogeneous cathode material in the markets. This technology allows us to be specific about the distribution of the transition metal elements, so that we can maximize the energy contained in the particle with the high safety and to the lowest the cobalt accountant minimize the risk and minimize the cost. \*The F CT material we produce can offer 20% higher capacity than what's available in the markets, and yet stays at 10% lower in cost because we minimize the cobalt content. So this material is also validated by Argonne National Lab. And we have won the low cost the fast charging USABC project with this material as well. \* So in the second column, we have this whole spectrum of the cell products that allows Microvast to to access the application of all industry. The broadness makes us less vulnerable to the commercial success of a single technology. So I mentioned about the LFP supplying to SAIC. So in this project, we actually competed with the CATL, the largest battery maker in the world. And we won this project by performance, and also demonstrates that Microvast has the quality control in our mass production line meeting for the most stringent automobile standards. So last but not least, we have the internal builds the vertical integration from r&d to production. So with the vertical integration, that can confer significant competitive advantages to shorten the product development cycle to win the race in tech evolution, by eliminating the need to communicate with with vendors. And that can minimize the cost. Ensure the quality control from the materials to the end product from r&d to mass production, and we can customize the solution to the client's needs. That helps us to build a higher bar to competitors. Because of the material development over decades. It also gave us the flexibility to work seamlessly with any customer. We can offer at the whole power solution level, at the pack level, module level, cell level and \*in the future in the components level\*.

another important feature of Microvast innovation and product design is the extensive simulation efforts. That helps to to optimize the battery system, and the predictors of potential issues in the computer before encountering the issues in physical devices.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  25:09

# (Slide 11 - MVs gradient cathode, aramid separator and proprietary electrolyte)

https://preview.redd.it/7ok3ryx8vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=16908c80fadd9df323ccd57a1b0d201be6e3913c

Yet, so during the fundraising, our investor hired a prestigious third party to do the technical assessment on Microvast - here are their conclusions.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  25:40

We talked about several components in the previous page that enables the high energy density, high safety, fast charging products, each are the gradient cathode material, so 100% polyaramid separator, and to the non-flammable electrolytes, and their contribution on the cell energy density, the charging rates, cycle life, and the safety summarize by the  third party as below. So the black bar showing the industrial leader and the dark blue are amongst the best in class. So the cathode material in their evaluation, for all those four aspects are amongst the best in the class. And the nonflammable electrolytes, its most advantage is in safety. It's an it's an industry leader. And as for Aramid separator, so it only contains less then 1% of the weights in the cells. And so that's not to change the cell energy density much and will not affect the cycle life much. But its contribution is still mostly in the safety, which is crucial for all the applications.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  26:58

# (Slide 12 - On a cell level)

https://preview.redd.it/g2gb78e9vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=889e7915080a6a40b8247f42d9d51f16ca9ec4fd

On a cell level, MV products Yeah, so the this also coming from the third party to the cell level, oh, every company has published their roadmap, and the compared with the largest the best in the field Microvast products that are leading in both of the volumetric energy density and the gravimetric energy density.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  27:57

# (Slide 13 - Tech Longer op life and increased safety)

https://preview.redd.it/vu4o3hu9vu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8480032830306dac049e365335251b90fec176

And comparing the performance, we briefly touched in the comparison, and also the means of market applications. And here are two of our products to compare with the leading performer and the standard performer. So as noted here, the leading performer data coming from the LG battery, and the standard performer and coming from the China EV cell maker, and most of the cycle life is ran from zero to 80% SOC. So that's what's coming from the third party database, comparing what's in the market. So that's also that's Microvast product that has been deployed to the market. So that's a fair comparison apples to apples. And as for the energy density, our HnCO, that's that's an NMC-2  is leading the energy density and still yet it can do the fast charging and for a lower energy density product, it can run three C cycling between zero to 100% SOC for over 8000 cycles. So, considering this case, in commercial vehicle, even if we charge twice or three times a day, this battery can last 15 to 20 years. And as for the safety both of this product is way beyond the leading performance

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  28:59

# (Slide 14 - Competitive Benchmarking)

https://preview.redd.it/ktxhoi9avu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de5c32d5d5e6592550fc701b0100c2b760f8cb9

and the for the future technology, we proposed such as the \*solid state battery\*, \*\*\*the close one would be the silicon containing product that we are in the would have been in the \*SOP phase\* in the next two years and also would keep improving the energy density by using lithium metal as anode. We're also working on this project with \*\*Dr Amins team\*\* together and also developing the the \*\*solid state battery that has been a project in Microvast Since 2015, we have over 12 patents in this area\*\* and also with a high temperature operating cells so more are being developed with the future technology.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  29:51

We are at the frontier of the innovations

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  29:54

# (Slide 15 - With its current product portfolio) Energy Density Competitors

so the comparing with competitors as the the timescale of the roadmap have proposed, that's where my Kovacs is standing.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:08

# (Slide 16 - Product Development Platform)

https://preview.redd.it/rjr00x4bvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a911f73260bd7177d63f8b7aa60a8ee96738830a

So, as I mentioned, we internally have the vertical integration from the cells all the way to the final products

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:17

# (Slide 17 - On a Pack Level - Higher Energy Density)

https://preview.redd.it/v3e2u6nbvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a2eaef95024809bd5cd751d08d06f1bf28621c

that help Microvast to gain the advantage in development time and also a thoroughly

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  30:28

in control BMS, because the BMS needed to understand how the cell would perform at a different Soh SOC, different temperature, different power requirements, power requirements and we have developed from the cells, our R&D has been going through the intensive testing for over 3-4 years before its getting into the mass production and how to apply that in the module, the optimal thermal control the pressure to be added the pack design, so that's all in this the vertical integration designing and the BMS have the intelligent control and we also have that in the digital twin that it can run a simulated virtual vehicle out of the cloud, well, on the road, you have this actual the vehicle operating and you can always comparing the predicted and the tested can send out early warnings. So that again, as the advantage gains a pack level, so, we are winning in both the volumetric and gravimetric energy density as well.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  31:45

# (Slide 18 - MV Batteries Best in Class Charging Speed)

https://preview.redd.it/t9nsfz3cvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ec0350ffc410b1cb2b02a0b54872db298126c9

So comparing the charging speed thats what Microvast is leading by far so that would offer more mobility to all kinds of applications and even the stationary energy storage wouldn't require such as the wind storage that would require a fast charging occasionally and that can also accommodate to this application.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  32:13

# (Slide 19 - Mutilayer Safety Measure)

https://preview.redd.it/vcckxyicvu381.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=56b7c6d2da465a5e66f516d9a8a75ac0e6ba625f

Yeah, so, the Microvast safety design as I mentioned, so, first of all, that has demonstrated good safety performance for the last 10-11 years. And we have a multi layer of safety design from the materials which is fundamental that can prevents the mass recall from happening and beyond that by fully understanding the cell performance

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  32:46

the pack design, the thermal propagation insulations, the pack design, and the most crucial is a BMS that it needs to take in place by separating the responsive time we also work closely with the OEM on the vehicle design the vehicle control unit as well. So the vehicle need to respond, the first to send out to the most of the early warnings, and then followed by the pack with a separated our responses time, to the packet cell to the materials that will go through the core of this, the whole technology there. And for the BMS we are having the ISO 26262 certified to the c level both on the software and the hardware.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  33:39

And even on the pack level, it has been tested for the electrical abuse and mechanical thermal environment. This one is impressive. \*\*So the whole pack is sitting on the external fire for over 10 minutes, and the pack remains safe\*\*.

Yeah, so here I want to give you a glance at Microvast mass production line from also four key battery materials to standardize the cell module and the pack. There are videos available online if you want to review more of our company facilities and our business on this right corner, there are two examples of the power system solutions offered for delivery trucks and the commercial buses. We have invested.

Organizer  34:45

That's only two minutes left. So

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  34:49

it's my last page though. Yeah, so yeah, I tend to welcome questions now.

Organizer   34:55

questions

Organizer    34:56

after the three talks. I know that you will not be able to join us for the discussion. But if there are questions, we will forward them to you by email so we can respond to the interesting parties. Okay. Excellent. Okay, so Well, thank you very much Wenjuan for this.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  35:19

Excuse

Organizer 2  35:21

me, she can ask us a question before the next talk. Is it possible? Okay,

Organizer   35:28

yeah. So, alright, so let's see if we have any questions from the audience don't see any obviously, this is more of an introduction of the of the the impressive technology that Microvast has. So, if there is any question regarding automotive Battery, I think she is the right person Okay, let's see that can we can answer these these questions. So.

Organizer  36:00

So, do some questions, some questions, okay. Can

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:06

you read them on my behalf.

Organizer  36:08

So, thanks for the great talk and your presence is LTO like a lot for lithium ion batteries, please any insights about using mixture of graphite and silicon

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:21

I'm sorry using mixture of graphite and what?

Organizer  36:25

yeah, graphite and silicon.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  36:27

\*\*Oh on the silicon yes, Yeah\*\*. So, so, for the safety material generally to families. So, pure silicone, and also the silicon mono oxide, silicone mono oxide as a smaller expansion, but I mean with the lower capacity that it can carry with larger particle size. And what we observe is this material per cycle efficiency is lower, but afterwards you can have a flatter decay. So, if you have the amount of the previous supplements that would have good be a good material to use, but again need to look closer into this material would just be the simply the mixture of silicon oxide. So, you can the oxide instead of a mono silicon oxide right and in the other class silicon material because of a four times extinction, this material needed to nanosized so that it can hold this integirty and that it comes in different formats, it can be the particles, it can comes in the silicon nano fibers all of those materials needed to have the surface to be quoted binds a carbon to avoid first cycle efficiency consuming too much lithium and in \*\*Dr. Amin\*\* actually have a patent published on this using the deposit grow silicon in between the graphene layers, that we have tested the material it shows a good performance in the lithium battery. So, really need some company to commercialize this material to be more massively used in the high energy density cells.

Organizer  38:14

So, I just look at the question now. So, there are two quick question that on silicone it seems to be the audience is interested to silicone. The first one is what is the ratio of silicone to carbon that is usually used by the industry and in your case, the other one is what is the strategy to stabilize the capacity or secondary in cycling?

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:34

Yeah, so,

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:34

depending on the energy density requirements also correlated with the cycle life. So for the cells about 300 to 330 watt per kg, the silicone components in the total anode material, if that's 100% silicone that would have been about a five to 10% and come in the silicone carbon composites and that is a composite content about 15 to 30 or 40% of the silicone and then if you want to reach a higher energy density above a 330 then the cycle life would reduce. So then the components total silicone components in the anode material would be about 18%. But if  applies silicone mono oxide and that can compost about 20 to 30% or even achieve 350. Yeah, so the key to apply the silicone material well is to accommodate its volume expansion from the beginning. Therefore, with such as the CNT above the conducting carbon, would be helpful so that it would stay in contact with the material even with the large volume expansion. But as then the key is to the well dispersion of this contraction of the carbon. And of course as the doctor \*\*value\*\* has been studying, the panders that to better can also help with the conduction conductivity. But it's still yet it needs to be resilient, better have the self healing power, but at least the goal to bind the  material tightly, and they kind of grow with the expansion. And you know, also, that you've actually designs a policy of actually design is also crucial. And beyond all that, the ?previous eviation? is a key technology and how to industrialize with a high safety low cost is also another focus. Excellent.

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  38:41

So the last question is from Mohammed Czechia.  is one of our analysts,

Mohammed  40:49

the one? Yes, thank you. Sorry. Thank you much for your presentation. I have just one question related to inefficiency, volumetric energy density, especially, you claim that in your in your pack, your energy density is higher than your competitors. And you mentioned so that you show that you're indigenously at cell level, it's it's comparable. Question is how we can explain this high performance pack level, you maybe design or your use, for example, easy to pack or can you say some more in this way, please? Yeah, so,

Dr Wenjuan Mattis  41:36

the practicality density, energy density, those can can be very in because of the cell format. So cylindrical cells would have really high volumetric energy density on the cell level, but not necessarily on the pack level, because you cannot pack really tightly, right, they can only use about 68% over the volume. So the pouch cells and the Prasmatic cells would have a higher packing efficiency Microvast makes the pouch cells, and comparing between this, the prismatic cells would have even higher efficiency, because it's already kind of like in the confined space, with the good mechanical protection already stability. But for the pouch cells comparing with prismatic cells on the cell level, it actually can advantages in both volumetric and prasmatic, energy density, because of existing skin. So even those who are in the fair competition, almost similar in the pack level, but what Microvast, again, on the pack level offers the energy density is by doing close to what c to p. So in each of these module, we have about 72 cells. So that's a big module. And to control this big module that would requires a thorough understanding of how this thermal field is designed, how to prevent the thermal propagation. So with all that, the know how and the knowledge base that we can minimize the components while at the same time maintains a uniform the pressure field, the thermal field, and also with the high safety design. So that's how we can get the advantages in the whole pack level. And also the in the pack we have the the bottom housing and the cooling plates, all in one that also using composites as as the cover of the housing that also reduced the weight. So with multiple levels of measures. Okay, well, thank you,

15339,SPX Correlated to United States Population Growth (or why you should always be skeptical),r9yi8k,"What if I told you that larger populations can support larger markets. 

Makes sense, right? More people in the market means a greater potential participation rate, more stability and as such more growth potential. If everyone who could bought 1 share of every stock in the S&P 500 (like, say, buying a non-weighted SPX ETF), that would mean that those people would establish a value baseline and reason for growth that scales up with the population.

Here's a graph below that demonstrates that we were, in the late 1990s, in-line between the growth of the market and United States population growth for the period, but after the accounting scandals in 2000, the trend was broken down and has only now returned to its normal baseline:

&#x200B;

[SPX vs United States Population Growth via FRED 1994](https://preview.redd.it/kvfc5jn5lu381.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b93834baf071bfe775436d191b206ee91a16aa5)

From this view, the correlation of the market looks pretty good. We have a long-term stability riding the trend, then a reduction and a gradual mean reversion back into the trend. If you're a bull, you look at this and see that the trend in the market can ride above pop growth, and you see that we can ride the trendline for an extended period of time. If you're a bear, you probably see approaching the number as a potential sign of decline.

&#x200B;

HAHAHAHAHAHA I'm just kidding. These variables aren't directly correlated. Population does have a relationship to market stability, and as such growth potential, but since people don't invest this way, all correlations between population and market growth become strained and have to be adjusted with other macroeconomic data and other market data to determine where the source of capital is originating, along with a host of other factors.

Here's the same exact graph zoomed out to a 1970 start from a 1994 start:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[SPX vs United States Population Growth via FRED 1970](https://preview.redd.it/4sjgppw1mu381.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fa8e79c8d8b4591aefbef1b77fbda2b72728874)

&#x200B;

Just by zooming the graph out, something that looked correlated now looks fairly arbitrary. There's still clearly a relationship (as you can plot increases in pop rate to increased stock activity 15-20 years later), but it's much more abstract and not predictive.

The moral of the story is it's possible to torture arguments and graphs to the extent that they look like they make sense when they don't. Whenever someone gives you a chart with 2 datapoints and/or a random line saying a stock is just going to go up or down because they say it fits a pattern, be very skeptical. 

You should, by default, doubt all of the simplistic TA on here, especially the crash porn which is really prone to shallow correlations and tortured graphs like this one.",1638764828.0

1) LULU has been witnessing supply-chain challenges, driven by the pandemic-led factory closures, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity, which are likely to impact its business in the second half of fiscal 2021. Recently, some of the factories in Vietnam, which are used to source lululemon’s products, have closed due to another wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in the region. This has delayed product deliveries in recent months.

2) The ongoing issues at the ports and reduced airfreight capacity have not only led to delays but also resulted in increased freight costs. These factors are likely to affect margins in the third quarter and fiscal 2021.

15493,"The ViacomCBS -VIAC - Saga: Part III, Return of Hwang",r9sd8r,"TL;DR - Since VIAC's $85 secondary in March 2021 that triggered the Archegos meltdown, when no one bank knew how levered Bill Hwang was, VIAC has been subjected to a huge amount of manipulation in order for institutions to recover those losses from $85 to \~$40. Recently it has been pushed below $29, below book value, despite showing huge growth in streaming, decreasing its debt, and a huge slate of new content for 2022. VIAC is now set up to see a huge rebound.

So I don't want to rehash what most everyone knows. But here goes. Bill Hwang pushed VIAC from the $20s all the way to $100 back in mid/late 2020 until it all blew up in March 2021 when VIAC took advantage of the share price at $100 and raised $3 billion by doing a secondary offering at $85. When institutions bought those shares, they had no idea how levered via swaps Bill Hwang was; and given secondarys cause the stock to immediately drop, it caused a margin call, and, well...

Since then VIAC traded in a channel from April 2021 to mid October 2021 in the $38-$42 range, with small pops to $47 and dips to $35. But it always stayed in that tight channel. For a reason. It was being manipulated to max pain on weeklies via institutions lending out their shares to HFs/MMs in order to turn VIAC into a premium ATM. It worked. No amount of good news could get it out of that channel; and there was a lot of it. All we've seen is growth in Paramount+, SVOD, subscriptions, and increase in Pluto TV, AVOD, MAUs. VIAC also has the biggest show across all channels and platforms: Yellowstone. It broke the record for most viewers for a season premiere, held by GoT, 6.6 million, with 13 million viewers for season 4. Incredible. Scatter pricing for ads for Yellowstone is absolutely huge.

Every single ER since Archegos has also been a beat on the top and bottom line - and in q3 they topped $1 billion in streaming revenue. This quarter they also announced they had a record of 1 million subs in just one week. [https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/368782/paramount-adds-a-record-1-million-subscribers-in.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/368782/paramount-adds-a-record-1-million-subscribers-in.html)

We are also seeing them start to aggressively consolidate all of their huge amount of content to their platforms, no longer licensing it out to Netflix, Amazon, Comcast - astonishingly of each of those competitors, 25% of their licensed content comes from VIAC.

https://preview.redd.it/c62uefow5t381.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e0b03b5db9a5f022085249aae48295fa4dc50d5

It is important to understand just how big VIAC's streaming platforms can be. Their sole purpose as a company is to produce and distribute content: that is all they do. They have the huge number of studios for production; and importantly they can \*distribute\* it via their own platforms and channels. They need to rely on no one. This image shows just how big they are - they are the \*second\* biggest producer of content, only Disney is bigger,

https://preview.redd.it/ppbjlu0f4t381.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=624538706faddd21b1c5179c57becf30e06d2207

You also don't want to discount how big CBS is. It dominates primetime. It is by far the number one channel, and as recent Nielsen ratings have shown, legacy is not declining.

https://preview.redd.it/hn0gzaie4t381.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd9e6fe4575860aef5c0bbba69c6dfe6230b3d5

Finally, 2022 is going to be a big year for VIAC in terms of new content; and very soon we will have two new huge new series on P+, 1883 and Halo. They'll also be dropping a new movie every week on P+ in 2022. All the while they are moving aggressively into international markets, increasing Pluto TV MAUs - it's already generated $1 billion for them since being acquired - and have a huge slate of live sports, news and other live events. Thanksgiving Day NFL game was the highest rated game in almost four decades!

Bottom line is this - VIAC is DEEP VALUE. They are showing HUGE growth, while trading BELOW book value. They have generated tons of FCF via sale of properties and have, and will continue to pay down their debt. There are very few companies left out there that are at once both deep value, while exhibiting growth; and more importantly, this stock has been heavily manipulated, at first being a premium ATM, stealing money from retail; and now, in the face of a great earnings and even more evidence of growth, the stock tanks to 52 week lows for over seven trading days in a row! The time is now, the gig is up. As Guy Adami said on Thursday last week on Fast Money, Yellowstone ALONE makes this a $40 stock! S0 don't miss out! This is the place to put your money - up 5% on Friday, best performing stock in the S&P that day, for a reason, because it is the most ridiculously undervalued stock in the market while still proving that it is growing!

So if Part I was ""VIAC Hope"" when it peaked post Archegos to $47 in late June; part II has been the ""Revenge of the Tutes"" from July to early December, and now, Part III is starting, ""The Return of Hwang""!",1638746356.0

# A Story

Now before we begin, I will tell you a story that might explain everything or explain nothing.

After 26 years of celibacy, the challenge was no longer enough. It was time to do no nut November. However, I stupidly start decided to get a head start in October.

For days I go without touching my wee wee. My mind constantly challenges me with sexual fantasies of having a harem of beautiful Korean women. However I fight off these thoughts.

""NO, I WILL NOT GIVE IN I SHOUT"" and the thoughts recede. I march onward in my quest not to nut.

But Alas, I can no longer take it! It is the morning of November 7th, a Sunday and I have nothing to do. My brain is on full sexual overdrive. This time, not only is it a harem of beautiful Korean women, but in addition, my waifu, Yoko Littner is there too!

""O HOW CAN I RESIST"" I shout. ""GOD SAVE ME FROM THIS TEMPTATION!""

God is cruel and does not save me. Suddenly my hands move toward my pp. It is hard as a rock. I sit in my chair, lean back and start thrusting. 20 seconds in, my fantasies have taken full control. Yoko and I are making a baby!

A flood of ecstasy fills my brain, my muscles tense. WACK. A rocket ship of thick, goopy cum smacks me in face. Between taking zinc which makes cummies thicker and not jerkin it for a three weeks, a fat thick load had erupted onto my face.

I am drained, exhausted and humiliated by the situation. I collapse onto the floor and cry, knowing I will be punished. Starting the next day, my stock portfolio has only gone done. What have I done :/?

# What is Inflation?

People will give you lots of different explanations of what inflation is but I think of inflation as having two different components.

1. Asset Inflation - When the amount of money in the system expands, it is likely the value of asset will also go up. Assets are inherently scarce and there's really no downward, disinflationary pressures (value goes down for other reasons, fear, need for money, etc.). Unlike consumer goods, we can't just use the cheap labor of third world countries to create more shares of a company to combat asset inflation.
2. Consumer Price Inflation - The price we pay for everyday goods and services. Gas, food, clothes, transportation, education etc. Now, what makes consumer price inflation not a purely monetary phenomena is we have a big old global economy, with ever advancing technology that allows us to produce more for less.

So from here on out, I'll be examining the forces that would cause consume prices to increase over the next decade and the forces that would help decrease prices over the next decade.

# Globalization

It is 1988, China has just spent ten years reforming agriculture under Deng Xiaoping. This caused a spectacular boom in the number of villages throughout China and ended the chronic food shortage that plagued China during Mao's rule. A fun statistic, during this ten year period, farmer's increased their aggregate income by 12x. Hot mama

Now, from 1989 to 1999, China starts exporting cheap textiles, toys and furniture. As word gets around about this cheap labor pool, US companies get a massive hard on. Cheap labour galore and boom, all our manufacturing starts moving to China.

This acts a massive disinflationary force as China becomes the global manufacturing power. At the same time, in our ever globalizing world, we optimize the fuck of our supply chains. With just in time manufacturing and delivery, companies are no longer producing a surplus of goods to meet demand but just the perfect amount. This keeps inventory levels low which reduces cost since storing inventory is shockingly expensive.

So starting in the 1990s we've had a huge boom in globalization which has given us access to cheap labour, allowed us to optimize supply chains and even give us access to cheaper raw materials.

This has been a big disinflationary pressure. Now, here is the problem that does keep me up at night.

1. China and the US, we are not getting a long anymore.
2. At the same time, COVID was a massive shock to our supply chains and exposed a lack of robustness in the system. When countries locked down, it caused massive disruptions since our supply chains require constant, consistent trade

If globalization slows down or stops, we will no longer have a disinflationary pressure on consumer goods. If globalization actually starts unwinding and countries bring manufacturing back home, this will be quite inflationary as the cost of good will have to go up in order to pay for the investments needed.

My gut tells me, we are likely entering a period where continued globalization stops and starts unwinding a bit. This will be the biggest inflationary force of the decade. The US world order seems to be crumbling and tensions are getting hotter with China. If I was Xi, I'd have constant wet dreams about conquering Tawian and the fact that the US is lead by an alzheimer's patient.

# Demographics

Over the next decade, demographics, hands down will be a big disinflationary force. When a country has a large, young population, that is a very inflationary force. Schools and housing need to be built. As they enter the work force they'll buy furniture, appliances and vehicles. They'll expand the amount of money in the system as they take out loans. This surge in demand and expansion in the amount of money, all act as an inflationary force.

Now, this what the boomers did and is one reason we had such high levels of inflation in the 70s. Today however, we have the total opposite problem.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3f3g76g3as381.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4ed3553203bc5c27288632ad91599ff7c41fba

Aging demographics is very deflationary. When people retire, their consumption decreases year over year as they live off their savings. At the same time, they aren't taking out loans so we have less money creation.

In addition to all of this, the young need to support the aging population, which means a lot of our money goes to paying their healthcare costs (i.e. paying crabby nurses to wipe their poopie butts). Less money for us, means less buying of goods.

With the largest global economies, all facing aging demographics, this means a slow down in global demand, again acting as a disinflationary force.

Quick side note -- With less workers in the economy, this will increase wages. However, this is not necessarily inflationary. On aggregate, if the total cost of labour increase that'd be inflationary but if the total cost of labour remains the same, not so much.

# Monetary and Fiscal Policy

Can't talk about inflation without talking about central banks. Here's the thing, when the FED enables cheap money through quantitative easing which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates, a lot of that just seems to cause asset inflation. People buy more expensive homes, lazy corporations buy back shares with debt,  Wealthy people increase their leverage, etc.

So the FED dinking around with monetary policy isn't as inflationary for consume prices as one might think. However, combine the FED with government fiscal policy and ooo baby can we create consumer price inflation.

Give me 1,200 dollars, I'm just buying assets. You give my half black cousin Tyrone $1,200, who lives in the hood, he's actually going out and spending that shit. Maybe he spends it at strip club, takes a vacation, whatever. Point is, he's gonna increase his demand for consumer goods, unlike me.

So the fiscal policy done during covid, was definitely inflationary. Tyrone told me, 2020 was the hottest summer of his life. He never had so much money.

But will these fiscal policies, targeted at giving the lowest income earners in society money continue? Currently it looks like it won't. This inflationary boom caused during covid will likely fizzle out.

At the same time, when the FED starts tightening monetary conditions, causing interest rates to rise, this will suck money out the system as the cost to service debt payments increase. This decreases the amount of money consumers and businesses, meaning less demand.

My conclusion, between no more big government stimulus to the lowest income earners and the FED starting to taper, in 2022 this will be a disinflationary force. Until it's not of course and the FED and US government reverse course so hard to draw any long term conclusion.

\*Random Side Note: rising interest rates, don't impact the economy right away. My buddy who works at the FED, worked on a project where they examined how long it take for an increase in interest rates to start having an effect on the economy. It's about six to nine months before the impacts are really seen. However, a fast increase in interest rates has a much faster impact (same with a fast decrease in interest rates).

# Technology

Last, we have technology. As technology advances, it is almost always a force against consumer price inflation. If Cathie Woods is right and this decade is an orgy of technological advancements with self driving cars, massive improvements in healthcare, major disruptions causing legacy companies to cut prices in order to compete, etc. the deflationary forces will be immense.

So in this case, it's a scale. The more technological advancement, the more force against consumer price inflation.

# Closing Thoughts

Will we have much high levels of consumer price inflation in this decade? In my eyes, it all comes down to globalization. If we start unwinding globalization, the inflationary pressures will be immense as we have to rebuild the infrastructure to manufacture at home. The forces of technology, demographics and tighter monetary conditions would not be able to stop that.

On the other hand, should globalization continue, perhaps we won't see consumer price inflation higher than 2% and what we currently see is actually ""transitory"" and short lived.

15634,Understanding Monetary Policy and It’s Relationship with Stock Prices,r9jwrm,"Many of you just took significant losses in your portfolio over these last 3 weeks (some all year), and sadly there is more to come. What is driving this sell off? A change in monetary policy. 

Scrolling through the daily chat I often find people discussing QE, even though few understand it. QE stands for quantitative easing and was first introduced in the US by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke as a response to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). QE(1) started in March 2009 and lasted til March 2010. The purpose of QE was to raise asset prices. During the GFC (2007-2008) many assets lost significant value. Included in these assets were homes, stocks, and bonds. These same assets were used as collateral in the financial system. By raising asset prices, the Fed and Treasury (these two are not independent) believed many banks could avoid margin calls, margin calls that banks couldn’t afford and would result in the fire-sale of the collateral at market price. 

This does not mean QE serves only a singular role. QE is now used to inflate asset prices (triggering the famous wealth effect), monetize deficits, lower interest rates, and increase employment. The Fed is currently tapering our 4th round of QE, which has resulted in the Fed having a balance sheet of just under 9T. This balance sheet is often referenced when you hear people say the Fed prints money. MMTers claim this money is “bank reserves”. 

The Fed and the Treasury are addicted to QE. We are only stopping QE temporarily as a way to control inflation. Inflation was never transitory and will continue well into 2023 (I will make another post about this). QE5 will be here in another year or two, and I suspect it will be at least 160B. Red or blue, the Federal Government loves to spend money it doesn’t have. This is where QE comes in and monetizes the deficits. 

I have been cash gang for months and am buying beaten down stocks. There are still many bubbles left to pop. 

Tdlr: QE enacted by the Fed raised asset prices to bubble levels. Smart investors have sold and are waiting for stocks to fall before buying back in as the Fed tapers. Monetary policy is the most important principle in determining stock prices.",1638723496.0

The media claimed that lockdown bullshit would teach Americans that they don't really need to fly so much and the amount of flying would permanently decrease. Americans were just supposed to look at people and places on the internet instead of seeing them in person.

Well, people want to fucking travel. I think the narrative of a permanent decrease in flights is false. If it wasn't for oil being up so much, flights would be even higher. The main deterrent now is the rising cost of tickets due to fuel costs and inflation.

2. Profit margin will be higher due to the simple fact that markdowns an incentives will no longer be needed to move inventory on dealer lots. 

3. Ford dealers will be able to reduce their real estate footprint. Consequently dealer overhead cost will be reduced substantially. In addition if the dealers sell off a portion of the unneeded land they will get a large cash injection on the sale. This can provide dealers the capital needed to reinvent themselves into a cutting edge experience based retail model.

16131,"Delist the Chinese stocks, I don't care!",r8qugj,"Full disclosure: my portfolio is about 25% into BABA and JD. This is not financial advice but an attempt to test out some wrinkles I recently grew on my brain. 

That being said, we have received confirmation yesterday on what will happen to the shares by Didi. The shares will be transferred to some ""international market"". This means you retards who own an overpriced Didi will be owning pink sheet stocks when the transfer occurs. Robinhood jabronies are probably F'd since you can't trade pink sheet stocks on that platform with the $6.50 fee required for each pink sheet transaction. At least that's what I pay on a reputable platform like TD Ameritrade. 

Are there other issues with owning pink sheet stocks?
There sure are! 
-Big funds won't be owning or transacting on that stock at all.
-financial reporting will be more complicated to receive
- I dont think you can get dividend payments on pink sheets

But what about the company? Specifically BABA and JD, double digit growth expected year after year for the next decade or so. I'm pretty sure being delisted doesnt mean they give up, they employ thousands of people, I'm quite positive each of those people will have employment after the delisting. 

Don't believe me?

At the time of this writing, what company is China's largest? Tencent, right? $TCEHY
I can purchase this monday at market open. It looks like you can make money on them because the company's performance is reflected approximately on their ticker price.

Any other problems?
Oh right, you apes with the options can't gamble on a pink sheet. Shouldn't that be a good thing? Haha all I see is loss porn on options except for this docusign implosion that people made money on.

TL/DR...Chinese growth stocks that are undervalued for their future performance should be fine if they get delisted. Retards can't do options on companies that get delisted. Buy when there is blood in the streets to turn $ 🚀🚀🚀🚀 into $$$$

Whether this was a knee-jerk reaction that came from human beings or purely the work of algos, the significant dip represents an opportunity for those who see ADBE as a larger and significantly more diversified business than DOCU, operating in spaces that have weathered the pandemic and even prospered quite a bit.

For reference, Adobe’s Document Cloud segment, which it’s e-signature offering falls into, makes up about 13% of Adobe’s business. It’s fair to expect Document Cloud to take a bit of a hit (though the e-signature product probably isn’t a huge contributor to revenue), but it is difficult to suggest that it’s other business segments, dealing with the content creation, content management, and digital advertising spaces, shrank or remained stagnant rather than growing. 

This feels a lot like a gift.

**1. Background**

For  those of you that are not aware of this company, simply put they are a  small biotech based out of Maryland. Prior to March of 2020 they  developed experimental vaccines for Ebola, influenza, respiratory  syncytial virus, and other emerging infectious diseases. Please note  'influenza' is where they had been working heavily prior to the covid-19  outbreak. In fact they had been working on Nanoflu (in a nut shell is a  more effective flu shot) which has shown to provide very effective  immune responses. When the world shut down and we got hit with the rona  they were in a good position to pivot and begin working on a vaccine to  save the world. You might wonder what is taking them so long? Simply  put, being a very small company with limited capital and resources they  couldn't compete with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or Moderna who just  so happen to be dominating the current market. However, the snails pace  development allowed them create a safer and more effective vaccine  versus the mRNA competition.

**How does the Novavax vaccine work?**

The  Novavax COVID-19 vaccine contains a protein (made using moth cells)  plus an adjuvant (made from tree bark). An adjuvant is an ingredient  added to boost a person's immune response, creating higher levels of  antibodies.

The  Novavax vaccine uses a telltale piece of the coronavirus: the notorious  spike protein. All alone, the spike protein is harmless and can't cause  COVID-19. When your immune system encounters the lonely spike protein,  it produces antibodies against it. This gives you protection against  future COVID-19 infection.

""Unlike  mRNA vaccines, the spike protein is already premade in the Novavax  vaccine. It's a shortcut,"" explains Dr. Florescu.

Like  other COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax does not cause COVID-19 infection. It  can't get you sick. This vaccine doesn't contain either live or  inactivated virus.

How did they get the spike protein?

The Novavax method uses moth cells to make spike proteins:

Researchers select the desired genes that create certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein).

Researchers put the genes into a baculovirus, an insect virus.

The baculovirus infects moth cells and replicates inside them.

These moth cells create lots of spike proteins.

Researchers extract and purify the spike proteins.

""The  Novavax vaccine has no genetic material, only proteins,"" says Dr.  Florescu. ""The vaccine technology is more traditional, and it's very  similar to a protein-based influenza vaccine.""

Influenza vaccines have also used this moth cell factory method.

What does the adjuvant (soapbark tree extract) do?

Adjuvants  increase the immune response to a vaccine. In this vaccine, soapbark  tree extract adjuvant makes achieving immunity possible with a smaller  dose of the spike protein.

Matrix-M  is the adjuvant used by Novavax. It is based on a saponin extracted  from the soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). The soapbark extract  encourages immune cells to activate, generating a more potent immune  response.

Saponins  are found naturally in various plant species like beans and green peas.  They're used in agriculture, animal feeds, veterinary vaccines and  human food. Saponins can boost immune responses to proteins. Using the  Matrix-M adjuvant, a smaller dose of spike protein achieves the desired  immune response.

**So just how effective was their vaccine in trials?**

Novavax  is another highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. Infectious diseases  expert Diana Florescu, MD, led the phase 3 clinical trial of the Novavax  vaccine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). ""It's  rewarding to help the development of a new vaccine,"" she says. ""The  research group was excited to bring this study to our community to help  curb the pandemic.""

Results of the clinical trial

93%  effective against predominantly circulating variants: Against the alpha  (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants, plus other variants of  concern/variants of interest, Novavax had 93% efficacy. The Novavax  vaccine had 100% efficacy against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.

Very  good protection against mild disease: Novavax's overall vaccine  efficacy was 90.4%. All cases in the vaccine group were mild.

Full protection against severe disease: The Novavax vaccine had 100% efficacy against moderate and severe disease.

Side effects

Common  side effects were injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, headache  and muscle pain. These typically lasted less than three days.

Who was in the clinical trial?

Over  29,000 people participated in the trial. UNMC was one of 113 sites in  the United States. ""We're grateful to all participants for their help,""  says Dr. Florescu. ""Major medical breakthroughs could not happen without  the generosity of the trial participants.""

""People  were so enthusiastic to participate,"" says Dr. Florescu. ""One family  included every family member in the trial. Grandparents, parents and  children – all three generations – took part in it."" Thirteen percent  were older than 65, a high-risk age group for severe COVID-19.

The trial also included people from multiple backgrounds:

20% Latino/Latina

12% African American

7% Native American

5% Asian American

**2. Market Opportunities**

Novavax  is targeting distribution to lower/middle income nations first. Why?  Because their vaccine is extremely cheap to make unlike the mRNA  vaccines and they are actually looking to stop the spread. Plus they  know the mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines are not working. The world  population is 7.9 billion people and right now only 42.7% are fully  vaccinated with a vaccine that doesn't even work and can potentially  cause severe side effects. That leaves about 4.5 billion people who have  not received a vaccine. And don't forget that boosters are being pushed  now. So in theory at minimum that is 3 doses per person approximately  13.5 billion doses (for those that have not been vaccinated). Now of  course it's safe to assume a good percent won't receive any vaccine ever  and Pfizer/Moderna will still receive a big chunk, but even a small 20%  cut could lead to billions in profit for NVAX. And if those that have  been vaccinated opt for the NVAX booster that's an additional 3.4  billion people.

How  will this small biotech manufacture enough doses? Well they are ramping  up and have the capacity at minimum to produce 200 million doses per  month. The manufacturing capacity in place is as follows (these numbers  add up to well over 4 bil per year and reflect max capacity):

Serum Institute of India - 2 billion doses annually

Novavax CZ - 1 billion doses annually

Fujifilm Diosynth US - 300 million annually

Takeda Pharmaceutical - 250 million annually

SK Bioscience - 150 million annually

Fujifilm Diosynth UK - 180 million annually

Biofabri - 100 million annually

Mabion - 120 million annually

National Research Council - 24 million annually

The  US provided NVAX with $1.6 billion in exchange for 100 million doses in  2020 as part of Operation Warp Speed which puts a price tag of $16 per  dose. I am thinking that this is on the higher end and the rest of the  world would probably bring an average price to around $10 (my guess ).

So  at a minimum of 200 million per month at $10 that's $24 billion in  revenue which should at least double the current market cap of 12.2  billion bringing the share price to around $324. As of right now there  are multiple price targets hovering around the $305 mark from actual  analysts.

If  they are manufacturing and selling 4.1 billion doses annually (as  indicated above) we could see revenue in the $41 billion area. That  would bring it to a share price of around $544.

Naturally,  I'm bullish as fuck on this company and I think we will soon see half  the market cap of Moderna who NVAX was initially running toe to toe with  in producing the vaccine. At a market cap of $61 billion the share  price would be around $809.

Let's  be honest, the covid shit isn't going away and I would be willing to  bet that it will become a seasonal thing similarly to the flu.  Fortunately, Novavax has had success coupling their covid-19 vaccine  with Nanoflu. This would be the ultimate kill 2 birds with one stone  cocktail that most people would prefer to take and could be a catalyst  for the stock price.

**3. The Conspiracy Theory**

So  you might be wondering why the fuck you've never heard of this company  if their vaccine's so great? The truth is that Pfizer has done  everything that they can to keep NVAX out of the media - similar to  getting shadowbanned on social media. He who controls the media controls  the narrative and right now Pfizer is pushing their shitty vaccine and  more boosters that are now 'safe' for kids. I don't believe any of that  bullshit. Personally my wife took the Johnson & Johnson (not mRNA)  vaccine and then caught covid a few weeks later. She still experienced  all the symptoms - fatigue, fever, chills, loss of taste/smell, etc. I  had not been vaccinated and she spread it to me and I experienced the  same shit. My sister took the Pfizer vaccine and caught the rona a week  later and was extremely sick for about a week. Lastly, a colleague of  mine who took the Moderna vaccine experienced extreme reactions to both  shots, still got covid, and has now been diagnosed with Rheumatoid  arthritis. What the fuck, these shitty mRNA vaccines aren't working and  Pfizer won't admit to it. Instead they come out with a new pill to help  you recover once you have covid. That makes zero sense because IF their  vaccine was effective there would be no need for a covid pill which  comes with severe side effects. This is the equivalent of going into the  condom manufacturing business and then your customers are complaining  because they're getting everyone pregnant because your condoms don't  work and so the solution is to provide plan-b? Personally I'd prefer to  risk it and just raw dog it, but that's me.

Moving  on to how Pfizer is fucking with Novavax. For those of you not aware  Pfizer worked closely with BioNTech developing the vaccine. On October  19th an article was released by Politico ([https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298)) simply bashing the company and their manufacturing failures, which Novavax positively responded to the very next day ([https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality](https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality)). Coincidentally this article road on the coat tails of the purchase of Politico by Axel Springer ([https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-completes-acquisition-of-politico))  which just so happened to be finalized that exact same day. Politico is  purchased by Axel Springer and then a couple hours later the article is  released shitting on Novavax. And since then, they have released  additional slander that has negatively impacted the stock price of  Novavax.

If  you connect the dots you will see that the CEO of Axel Springer (German  company) has had strong ties to BioNTech (German biotech) since the  very beginning of their vaccine development. The red flag is that the  article released on Oct 19 in addition to others dating to present day  are being published as Novavax begins submitting for approval to the  World Health Organization (WHO), European Union (EU), UK, Australia,  Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, India for the Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA). Oddly enough, the articles all have 'anonymous'  sources without a single credible source being named.

$1  billion is a drop in the bucket to bash a company when you have a  market cap of $306 billion and endless control over the media and  governments around the world. Every single time Novavax releases  positive news, within a few days an article is released bashing them OR  Pfizer happens to release some positive news about their covid related  products. What they don't want you to know is that they put in a request  to not release any of their covid related data to the public for the  next 55 years. What they don't want you to know is that some of their  data was skewed in their trials to receive an expedited approval. What  they don't want you to know is that Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA  commissioner in charge of regulating Pfizer is also on the board of  directors of Pfizer, Stephen Hahn is a former FDA commissioner in charge  of regulating Moderna is the current Chief Medical Officer of Flagship  Pioneering (the venture capital firm behind Moderna), and James C. Smith  who is the CEO of Reuters and is on the Board of Directors for Pfizer.  This is a major red flag to me.

And  where the fuck do all these 'Main Stream' media outlets like CNN, CBS,  CNBC, Reuters, USA Today, The New York Times, Business Week, etc.  receive their advertising money from? Fucking Pfizer. Just check out  this short clip...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1h6l-eXJw)

And  I'd like to point out that government officials are well aware of  Novavax and it's effectiveness. Here is a very short clip recently by  Rand Paul indirectly referencing Novavax. Why he won't mention the name  of the company is beyond me.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzn045EtcQc&t=132s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzn045EtcQc&t=132s)

**4. Summary**

After  endless slander in the news and repeated short attacks (more than  likely by hedgies with money provided by Pfizer) the Novavax share price  has taken a serious hit and is very undervalued. Novavax has a solution  that will actually work, has no severe side effects, and soon the world  will know about it. As of writing this Australia expects to have a  final decision on NVAX ([https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20](https://twitter.com/TillaInvest/status/1466575400591507456?s=20)) in the coming days.

My position is a total of 1396 shares that cost me $220,318.10 (See Screenshot Below).

I am looking for some serious movement to the upside over the next 87 days. Do your DD and make the right choice.

Side note, if you find any holes in this research, fill them in like my wifes BF does to her.

16343,Straddling the shit out of this market?,r8gaht,"No matter if the crash is here or not, I only see two short term outcomes in this market for the next week or two:
- People panic sell out of fear of a correction, causing the crash
- People buy the shit out of the dip since almost everything is on a 10-15% discount

No matter what, this most likely means high volatility, like we've seen for the past week. This means that straddling (buying equal amounts of puts and calls ATM) could be really profitable, especially if we start experiencing an alternance of red and green days with high changes in prices, allowing both the puts and the calls to be profitable.

  $YANG shorts the top 50 Chinese companies. If there’s consecutive big red days for China, it can go to $100 or more in a short period of time.

  China is about to eat massive shit. Potential COVID lockdowns, going to war with Taiwan, developers defaulting one by one, the whole economy will probably red for the next few months. Even if some industries do well for some reason, the big failing industries could make every industry eat shit together.

16552,I learned my lesson: A RobbingHood Story.,r8a6sj,"Read until end: 

I wanted to tell this story because I figured some apes would find it amusing and to give a heads up to anyone still using Robinghood or margin. 

Today I received my first margin call liquidation. My balance was skimming the line and I was hoping it would bounce and it didn’t. To begin, yes I am retarded but second, **do not let brokers exercise a margin call on you**. Get money in your account, cover that F***ing call or they **will** fuck you. They will not exercise their liquidation with any form of rational or ethical discretion and **will** make the worst sales possible to cost you the most amount of money possible.


Now, for the story.


Today at 10:38 a.m. Robbinghood liquidated 180 shares in my account netting me a $600 loss. 


At the same time they handed me this loss, they could have instead exercised the decision to liquidate a different position of mine. A position which would have covered the same amount of margin due and only accounted for a total loss of $2. Not $2 per share but 4 shares (as opposed to 180) for a total $2 loss.

I called customer service and asked them what the f*** made them decide that was an ethical way to liquidate. They agreed it was bad judgment, agreed they could correct it and then told me that despite both of these points they won’t (I am dead serious).

The cherry on top? The stocks RobbingHood sold at a massive loss were RobbingHood shares. That’s right. The only reason I had a margin call to begin with was because I invested in them. I stupidly took a chance on their shit company, they sucked and then penalized me for their suck. What a spit in the face.

To end on a positive note, I just liquidated my entire account and switched to WeBull closing my RH account, forever. Let this be a warning to all those who like me, ignored the warnings of so many on here.",1638569155.0

16615,DIDI delisted ? BUY HUYA,r890el,"Assumption : Delisting of DIDI is exclusive towards DIDI because they didn't listen to Daddy Xi's warnings before they IPOd. HUYA, BILI, NIO, XPENG, PDD, JD  will not be delisted because they have been good boys.  


Opportunity : With the massive sell-off because of fears sparked by DIDI delisting, I would argue that this is the best opportunity to buy Chinese equities cheap specifically HUYA. Okay but why specifically HUYA ? 

The thesis is this :  Many of the largest gaming events (by number of viewers)  happened at the start of Q4 (October).  I looked at HUYA's financial statement and it concluded in September 30th  2021. And if you look at the image I cropped,  in Q4 there was the TI10, LOL Worlds 2021, CSGO Stockholm 2021, Mobile Legends Season 8 (it's South East Asian so HUYA subsidiary NIMO.TV covers this ),Call of Duty Masters China. These events had the most amount of viewers in gaming history and all of them are aggregated in one quarter. This will mean HUYA's user activity will be the highest as of Q4. Simply based on Q3 numbers, they have already managed to show growth despite to average MAU of 85.1 million despite having not much events going on in Q3. I estimate a MAU of 120 million for Q4 showing a 50% QoQ increase, and 200+% YoY increase. 

I see this as a golden moonshot opportunity. HUYA rallied hard last earnings from 7.00 to 10.00 despite average earnings. This could easily be a $18.00 rally. Baba's investor's day may also cause this stock to move upwards because this stock correlates with BABA heavily since the tech crackdown.   


The play :   
Accumulate as much shares as possible below 6.50 or buy calls with strike of $9 expiring in April 2022. (Q4 earnings are released in early March)

AMC is down on the fears of Omicron variant leading to shut downs. I see this as highly unlikely and am using the pull back as a bullish opportunity.

The way I see it we have seen so far this variant focused on the unvaccinated and not with significantly worse illness. Now We are sure to see the Vaccine wane in its immunity due to these 32 mutations to the spike protein, where the RNA based vaccines have there focused. But despite this, we have rapid expansion of the booster shoot program that not only elevates immunity passed the highs of the second shoot, but way passed as to create a much lesser chance of severe outcomes or death. Obviously the Holliday season should lead to much wider spread and this is a much more transmissible variant, but I doubt it will lead to shut downs. 

Shut downs are right now political kryptonite nobody wants to touch .",1638564202.0

What did he do, and what can we learn from this legend?",r86occ,"ControlTheNarrative was an easy-going Redditor that went on his day-to-day basis talking about politics that were rather less about what democrats and republicans were doing, but more about hating on women and discussing capitalism and socialism. This is standard for the average Redditor. That is until he found WallStreetBets. 

As a total unit of complete degeneracy, he previously lost 32k in a single trade. (I couldn't find the screenshot of that loss.) Anyway, our fearless hero thought to himself on how to get what he had lost with the 2k that he still had, and of course (like any degenerate) he decided to leverage his way to victory. He did so by enabling margin on Robinhood gold, (that required a minimum of 2k) because he enabled Robinhood gold he can barow the exact amount that he has, so he barrowed 2k, so now he has 4 thousand dollars, half of which is barrowed money. Now he goes to buy 100 shares of AMD that cost him about 3,800 dollars, so he goes and sells a call, and he sets the strike price at 2 dollers getting about 3288$, 88 dollars he made profit. This profit is nessesary to making robinhood think you can profit again. Repeat that process a lot of times and now ControlTheNarrative has 50k, thats is 1-25 leverage. He stoped there because it's his ""personal risk tolerance"". 

The next step towards becoming a wallstreetbets legend is to buy OTM calls that expire in two days on APPL. Like any autist he went live to show his reaction of the stock market opening with his new fate right in front of his face. And the moment the market opened GUH was his reaction, a sound so elegant it will motivate the next generation of degenerates to follow, and his face to remember for eternity.

16935,"$BB - Blackberry, the sweetest of fruits! DD inside",r839ze,"Alright, I've been watching Blackberry ($BB) and put together a little rundown of DD to share.

In case you haven't seen, Blackberry - the company everyone knew and loved for their smart phone with the cool track ball and easy keypad that lost the race to iPhone, has become a company focused on cyber security and IoT (Internet of Things).

Quick info on IoT - *The Internet of things describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.*

Back to $BB - They divide their business up into three sections, two of which are viable for future outlook, and one that is closing soon via a patent sale potentially incoming (more on this later).

Here's a breakdown of the technologies/services/products in each and the financials behind each one:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Breakdown of 3 portions of business, blue border is the go forward two, without border is the licensing portion being sold off.](https://preview.redd.it/jdu6iufruc381.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d73bd21d360891c716904024b5ef09b35a9544)

&#x200B;

[Solid margin on IoT, Cyber Security taking margin hit as they build infrastructure but is a clear winner in their market share.](https://preview.redd.it/3aoglj6tuc381.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c3a3c874a158666cac3e8874a8d71655141cbc4)

&#x200B;

IoT and Cyber Security - Blackberry is a major player in these sections. Some snippets include: 

* BlackBerry has design wins with 24 of the world’s leading 25 EV automakers, who represent 82% of global EV volumes. Increased from 23 of the top 25 last quarter
* BlackBerry IVY™ to deliver secure vehicle based payments, leveraging vehicle sensor data and edge processing to create a “digital fingerprint”. Delivered through a partnership with Car IQ
   * Major indications based on future potential with app usage in cars.
* 18 of the G20 governments utilize Blackberry technology
* 45% of Fortune 100 are customers to Blackberry verticals
* Utilization across everything from corporate cyber security, to autonomous flood risk monitoring, to train traffic management.

Ok, but what will it do in the future?

* Automate cyber security defenses utilizing AI/ML technologies? yup
* Provide security for autonomous vehicles, act as a gateway for app producers in EV, and produce a better experience for the driver and passengers using realtime data? that's the plan
* Integrate additional safety measures into software utilization for government/corporate personnel, and act on potential faults? absolutely

Let's be real though, I don't understand all of this, otherwise I'd just get a job there and buy all the stock options I could. So let's talk notes we can understand:

* Blackberry is looking to sell off its major holding of mobile patents and licensing. Their goal is to close by end of year with backup potential buyers quickly in 22' if that falls through. Here we have a major potential influx of cash. We lose out on the revenue potential as noted above, with a very nice 80-90% margin, but it propels them with funding into the future for further acquisitions, sales team buildouts, and engineer support. Pro/Con evens out.
* Their market share is huge, without knowing anything else, the team can pull revenue and ongoing wins out of that.
* Revenue - winding down as they remove sales from licensing and roll into their core two business models. Costs are rising due to onboarding more sales teams and additional administrative support (according to their last earnings call), I would imagine this levels off as revenue builds and onboarding slows. Basically, the ramp up for continued expansion.

Insider Trading (see below for charts):  
Great indication here that while we have some sales, they're all paired for the most part with vesting options and only portions of the shares sold. What this tells me is people are vesting into their options, executing, selling portion for cashflow, and holding the rest. You can't blame them, when you work somewhere for a period to vest you want to see some instant gratification (and by instant we mean scheduled based on terms). The huge indication here is how much holding is going on. Even with the rise of the price due to ""meme"" status in recent periods, we still have people holding onto shares for greener pastures.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[As we see most options executions to gain shares are met with sales for cash, but often insiders are keeping good portions of shares - showing belief in the company.](https://preview.redd.it/u3r3dp3xuc381.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba66e7d9a41773573c7eed0040406fba3ea493f)

&#x200B;

Institutional (see below for charts):

This one can go both ways, but I see a major benefit in some of the players here.

Yes you have people like Allianz Asset management selling off shares - reasonable considering potential profits or necessity to allocate funds elsewhere based on their mission.

But you also see big players like Morgan Stanley (+864k shares), Vanguard (+606k shares), Bank of America (+458k shares), Blackrock (+108k shares), and more loading up. 

Overall, I think we have some profit taking, some people jumping ship, but huge names setting up for the ride.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chart Analysis - For those that like the voodoo magic crayon drawings:

* strong support/resistance established multiple times in the 9.30 - 9.35 range
* uptrend line from January 21' to present day shows increasing lows on all major dips
* multiple blow off tops between Dec 20' and present day, but difficult to attribute negative company data as stock has reached ""meme"" status through multiple periods. 
* Blackberry transitioned to software between 2015-2016, with the latter being when they stopped making phones. So it's hard to utilize long term data, but they have seen price action as high as about 28.80s and as low as about 2.70s. We've been in an upward trend since Nov 20' with a bit over the top volatility.
* Historically in this time period we're at some of the lowest RSI on the daily, it doesn't typically dip lower than the 30-34 range except for some key periods.

Let's Recap - Blackberry has a strong product offering, huge market share, and is consolidating it's business to the major industries it wants to run in. There's a large cash injection catalyst potential incoming with their IP sale, that likely isn't entirely ""priced in"" as the deal has not been talked about in detail (dollars and cents) in public. Costs rose a bit with decreasing revenue, but from a business perspective and looking at their solid cash position, this is to be expected as they settle into their administrative needs for their next expansion legs (basically, gotta spend money to make money). 

  
Position - Yes I am in on this. Currently sitting on 540 shares @ $9.62 cost basis, Mar 22' $11 calls x 9, Dec 22' $15 calls x 2. Looking to pickup another 100-200 shares in the coming days, and may grab some ITM calls for Jan 23', still weighing out what portion I want to contribute to this thesis. I don't think this will be an instant gratification play, but something in the next 6-12 months will show solid results and 2 years+ will show huge gains.

17007,Alibaba $baba-how to internalize the fallout,r828k9,"Look, baba is in a bad spot right now—no denying it. It’s ugly. As a large bag holder, it hurts & I’d be lying if I said I was not worried. BUT in ‘00-‘01 Amazon went from $100+ per share to $6 per share. In 2017 $AMZN broke $1,000. It took time. It might take baba 5+ years to recover. But let’s not forget, they are a tech company (intrinsic value), they dominate the market in China, China has a growing economy & is among the largest in the world, & the company could close its doors today & sell off its assets for more than the current market cap. There is value here. It just might take time to realize. So it all depends on your investment time horizon. My avg is around 170. If baba hits 1000 in 15 years that’s a 33% annualized return YoY. Not bad. 

You also can’t time the market. Which is why you DCA. But, if you don’t want to try catching a falling knife so to speak, wait. Wait for a consistent clear reversal. You’ll never time the bottom perfectly. And the share price won’t shoot up over night. Whether you buy at 110 or 120 won’t really matter if this sees 1,000 in the next 15 years. So buy when you feel comfortable, and maybe it’s wise to wait for it to start trending upward. For those with a pre existing position, just DCA. 

This is where money is made. high risk scenarios. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the people smart enough to buy homes in ‘08, while most were running, made a killing. The folks buying Amazon as the tech bubble was bursting, made a killing. On the flip side though, the people buying bear sterns (cough Kramer cough) as it was crashing, lost everything. So this has now become a high risk play. But, it has huge potential (to both make you rich or broke). You need to decide for yourself if the risk is worth it. But this is where real money is made. Just ask roaringkitty/deepfuckingvalue—he was buying a dying company that no one would touch.",1638546994.0

It’s a battery technology company that is building the next generation of battery technology. Management believes it’s in an industry “primed for disruption.” At this point they don't have revenue and they're looking to build out their technology slowly. They're starting with 3D Silicon Lithium-Ion batteries that are used for wearables, handsets, and laptops (the first batteries just came off the line.) It will be years before they move to something like technology for EVs. So the underlying question is, is management right? Is battery technology the next industry that’s primed for disruption?

#[Stock futures little changed ahead of November jobs report as omicron concerns loom](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat in early trading Friday ahead of the November jobs report as the market nears the end of a roller-coaster week driven by Covid omicron variant developments.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 also were barely in negative territory.
*****
> Stocks tied closely to the virus have led the market on its week-long seesaw, and that continued Friday. Companies that benefit from the economic expansion, such as hotels and airlines, led losers, while vaccine leader Moderna was among the biggest gainers, with its shares rising 3.4% in premarket trading.
*****
> Hilton Worldwide was off 1.4% and Delta Air Lines fell 1.2% premarket.
*****
> The omicron variant has now been detected in five U.S. states, with symptoms so far reported as mild.
*****
> The November jobs report is set for release Friday morning. Investors expect to see solid job growth last month, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones predicting 573,000 jobs added in November and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.5%.
*****
> The three major indexes rebounded in Thursday’s regular trading session. The Dow gained 617 points. The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%.
*****
> Thursday’s gains continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means. The Dow is down 0.7% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have lost nearly 0.4% and 0.7% since Monday, respectively.
*****
> Elsewhere in markets, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi announced during Asia trading hours on Friday that it will start delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and make plans to list in Hong Kong instead. Shares fell 4% in premarket trading.
*****
> On the data front Thursday, initial jobless claims totaled 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 27, lower than economists expected.
*****
> Despite Thursday’s rally, the averages are on pace for a losing week. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are each about 0.7% lower on the week, while the S&P 500 is down 0.4%.
*****
> “With rising cases of the virus, a less accommodative Fed, and tougher growth comps in the year ahead, the uncertainties around the outlook may simply be building — resulting in a more volatile environment for price discovery,” Goldman Sachs’ Chris Hussey said in a note.

The timing of the patent sale announcement. He used a couple interesting phrases including “Most likely by Christmas” and “Our investors will be very pleased”. I work in finance (this is not financial advice, do your own DD yada) and it’s obviously hard to time the market, but this play is served up on a silver platter. At these levels with strong support at $9 and catalysts on the horizon, I like the risk/reward here. I’m both short term bullish and long term on BB’s turnaround story but rarely see such a great setup for a short term play.

For all you “iT’s PriCed In!” turds, it’s not. The details and magnitude of patent sales this size are rare and unknown. There are no wallstreet/hedgefund models to price it in. Can it surprise to the downside? Of course. But that’s why we’re all playing this fun game aren’t we. 

Another catalyst- January 5th to the 8th 2022 is the CES Tech Conference in which BB is participating (along with MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, FB and more) to showcase their IVY tech and upcoming projects. This is a serious catalyst to start 2022.

It’s uncle BB’s time to shine. Highest conviction play right now. Double gun salute tardos. Mega Beast.

17231,what happens to share of a Chinese company that gets delisted,r7wxha,"Chinese company traded on an exchange like the Nasdaq would cease. Stock listed on established exchanges are part of a system of regulation and institutional operations that can offer certain investor protections.

&#x200B;

1. If it cease to trade in nasdaq it doesnt mean we cant trade. There are many brokers who offer OTC markets. ( over-the-counter )
2. Well, we all know hw much regulation would actually help a retail investor. What help did they do when Robinhood ceased GME trading ?

&#x200B;

**Case study :**

Last summer, Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee was delisted from the Nasdaq after the company revealed the fabrication of 2.2 billion yuan ($340 million) in sales. The stock hit a 52-week low of 95 cents a share. But shares rose even after going “over-the-counter” and closed at $8.64 each on Monday. (0.95 to 8.64)

&#x200B;

Why did this happens ? It is due to low liquidity the stocks move violently which is great for retailers who love AMC and GME.

&#x200B;

**Case of AliBABA :**

Alibaba Group (BABA) stock plummeted on news that the Chinese Communist Party (""CCP"") intended to ban foreign VIEs. 

&#x200B;

1. Cunt bloomberg reports suggested that Beijing was planning on banning foreign listings entirely  would result in BABA and 247 other companies worth a collective $2.1 trillion being delisted.
2. Many fud have voiced the opinion that Alibaba is at risk of being delisted.

The claim was made in publications like Bloomberg as well as smaller outlets.

&#x200B;

**Important :**

**Recently, China's own securities regular chimed in on the matter, saying that a ban on foreign VIEs was not being considered.**

China's securities watchdog CSRC says reports on China's possible bans on overseas listing through VIE are NOT TRUE. << official tweet>>

&#x200B;

[https://twitter.com/Sino\_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\_&ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846](https://twitter.com/Sino_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846)

&#x200B;

**Going by these reports, it appears that China won't be banning foreign VIEs, and that BABA won't be delisted. For the short term, at least, the stock is staying on the NYSE.**

&#x200B;

**PART 2  : However, the possibility of delisting is important for knowledge gain.**

&#x200B;

What would happen when a Foreign Stock is Delisted?

If you hold a foreign stock and it gets delisted from a U.S. exchange, you still own the stock. A stock's listing status has nothing to do with ownership rights: your holdings are still valid. However, you lose the ability to trade the stock on U.S. exchanges, and its NYSE or NASDAQ ticker disappears. In this scenario, you may still be able to trade the stock OTC. Most brokerages allow OTC trading, though not all stocks are supported. As part of this article, OTC stocks inside a brokerage account:

**Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY).** 

**( VWAGY a full $125 billion )**

&#x200B;

In BABA's case, the stock would likely be tradeable, since it has a large market cap and already has an OTC ticker **(OTCPK:BABAF)**.

If BABA were delisted your broker would roll you over to the OTC shares, allowing you to trade them that way. The above is pretty much what happens to investors still holding a stock when it is delisted. 

&#x200B;

Option 2 for BABA'

&#x200B;

**Converting BABA shares to 9988 shares.**

&#x200B;

'9988' is the ticker symbol for Alibaba on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Each 9988 share is worth 1/8th of a BABA ADR. This means that you can have your broker convert each BABA share you own to eight 9988 shares. Then, you will have regular exchange-traded shares that trade during Hong Kong business hours Monday to Friday. In order to get them, you may have to call your broker.

&#x200B;

**""DONT PANIC AND SELL in this FUD""**

&#x200B;

**Cathie Wood’s money managing firm Ark Invest on Thursday for the first time bought shares in the U.S. listed Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc on the dip . Ark Invest picked up 277,263 shares — estimated to be worth $13.39 million .**

&#x200B;

CHINA DE-LISTING: DIDI SHOCK & What It Means for NIO, XPEV, BABA - 11/26  
[https://youtu.be/xnIdTtdmJEI](https://youtu.be/xnIdTtdmJEI)

Be warned, the video is over an hour long!

Here's the one on VIEs from his Twitter account

China Bans VIEs!  Are Delisting Fears Real for NIO, BABA, LI... - 12/1  
[https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1djxXPzXAkzxZ](https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1djxXPzXAkzxZ)

Still, I think the market will do what the market does with news (DIDI+Omicron) and we'll see some more buying opportunities in the near term.

Here's an overlay of the HSI (blue) over BABA for the last year. 

[HSI\/BABA](https://preview.redd.it/2u7lz818o9381.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=351a6087f8aab9512b4ae417467c90d91ea6623b)

For reference, as of 10/29/21, Alibaba was only 8.05% of the whole index.

[BABA weight &#37; on HSI](https://preview.redd.it/7e0cz2k1p9381.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=bffae363f8b5cc9aefa36a6dd25973f359a0eb7d)

Alibaba seems to be following fairly close to the Hang Seng Index. If the trend continues and once CPP is done messing around with VIEs, HSI will definitely go up and we can finally rejoice.

I know it's risky but I'm bullish on Alibaba and I think the company will see some green not too far into the future. Then again, I'm just a damn retard and definitely not a financial advisor. Do your DD folks!

17347,Gambling my kid's christmas present money on CORN and RIVN,r7rjak,"Listen dummies, one of probably one things is about to happen. Taper ongoing, market is trying to pick a direction, bers are getting horny when their supposed to be hibernating, the market can smell blood and one way or another next year we could see the big dump we've all been waiting for when the rates start going up and blah blah blah who even reads this shit...


So why CORN? Compare this (the shit that makes corn grow):

[Fertilizer supply rocketing after China and Russia cut off the rest of the world](https://preview.redd.it/bv5chesyg9381.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4319cf1e33d78b6874762d0db331e8a2d5b82b53)

 To this (The shit Chinese nitrogen grows up to be):


[CORN Futures ETF](https://preview.redd.it/i76yc01gh9381.png?width=1604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8e6763c9b30677672b7813dd8f3209d24c0f91)

Fertilizer sky rocket is not priced in to the corn market yet. Not even close.


So why RIVN puts, well RIVN is just such an obvious bull shit end of the dot-com bubble style stock it's a no brainier. But it's also a nice little hedge against the corn play. If JPOW decides hes not fucking around and pulls the rug and blasts rates to fight the fight against inflation, commodities might take a near term nose dive but RIVN will never recover. If the market wavers short term and JPOW saves the day again and prints enough cash for infra bill 2.0 you better believe commodities are ripping. Most likely JPOW slowly eases into the rate hike and we get CORN ATHs and delisted RIVN and we win it double big.


TLDR: CORN calls for if market goes uppies, RIVN poots for if market goes downsies

Alot of what I trade is in Canadian but to make it easier for you guys to understand i've changed the amounts to all USD. 

[Last 12 months trading](https://preview.redd.it/unpgnk1yu8381.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50188854c66b2845e52d62f343176321cef5f301)

Was in a great recovery already heading into 2021 after MJ stocks did their first rip back up and I recovered from my multi year $APHA bags. 

Major losses (realized)

$MVIS when I paper handed and couldn't stomach the massive drop. 

$AMC also couldn't stomach the massive loss and sold out

EV charging spa-c that I can't name. was greedy, held out for more and lost a ton because I tried to diamond hand it instead of cutting my losses earlier.

Big gain (realized): $GOOS  I had strong conviction on that play and made a massive amount on the earning bump.

&#x200B;

[All realized gains and lost for past 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/16edey0pw8381.jpg?width=754&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2143eab33b6cf9e81166e6242a5f98b7f1bb2ce0)

What's the last bet for 2021? 

Enbridge! $ENB is a midstream oil&Gas. 

It's revenue is made up of selling commodities (almost no profit),  nat gas distribution and finally pipeline toll fees. 

They make nothing meaningful from selling oil & gas. look at the red. bascially yes they do move with oil markets but their profit and everything is from their pipeline tolls.

&#x200B;

[ENB commodity oil&gas sales barely or don't cover their costs. The real money in in the pipeline and tolls](https://preview.redd.it/l373nr0ux8381.jpg?width=886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77eb9ec104f8bc0ffcf6f70f7c89dc6029ec35e5)

Enbridge is one of the largest midsteam players with key pipelines that are over subscribed. Basically since no one is allowing anyone to build pipes, they have a lock on volumes for next while. Their transportation/pipelines make money regardless of commodity prices and their risks are political in nature.

Line 5: [https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/12/01/news/michigan-line-5-court-case-enbridge](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/12/01/news/michigan-line-5-court-case-enbridge)

Line 5 is heavily disputed and there are alot of news/political risks associated with Line 5. However everyone still strongly believes that there will be no near term decision, that the pipe isn't turn off overnight.

Catalyst: Dec 7 is their investor day where they provide their 2022 guidance, address how much they will grow their 2022 dividend (currently at 7% yield) and address questions on Line5 and probably mainline.

I am holding my position based on the Dec 7th catalyst and next earnings because:

1. No one can build a pipeline. it's political suicide. But ppl still need to transport and pipelines are safer then by truck or rail. So Enbridge is in a key position to maintain high usage of their assets
2. Dec 7 should be a good forward looking catalyst. I expect that they will announce new projects and that they are doing a sharebuyback and looking for accretive acquisition targets. There are many articles that speak to their cash flow and their big opportunity for next year
3. Many shareholders are institutions and large funds. This is a defensive stock in a time of risk and i'm prefectly happy to hold my position and live off a growing 7% yield. I do believe that more shareholders will grow their ENB position as fears about oil&gas taking a covid hit go away

My position below: Parking my earnings in $ENB and going to ride out the kangroo stock market for the next few months.

**Firstly the fundies**

Balance sheet is looking absolutely phenomenal for a barely unprofitable business. Current ratio a whopping 9.78 fuelled mostly by a strong cash and short term investment positions. In other words this company is in zero risk of going under anytime soon. Was some of that cash generated by fucking me over with a small sized dilution, Yes, but that's not your problem anymore. Total assets sitting at just shy of a fat billy (up 40% from 2k20) and about 70 mil in liabilities. Giving them a book value/equity of 900mil. Current market cap, a dismal 1.8 billion. Please give me an example of another growth stock with that retarded of a ratio. Is 250 mil of those assets goodwill? Yes, but fuck u don't worry about it.

1. There was an FDA complaint about 1 polymer being used in one branch of one of DM's smallest acquisitions. Ambulance chasers went nuts and stock went down. Envisiontec CEO was fired and third party was used to investigate. Pretty solid leadership by Ricky F. daddy there. (Cant link but seekingA has a good article)
2. Wash Sale season. Taxes coming up, lots of significant losses on this stock, pretty shaky reason but I don't doubt it.
3. Shorts, up to 15% of float as of middle of November. I don't doubt that has also increased. [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/DM/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/DM/short-interest/)
4. Their fucking q3 earnings results. God this one pisses me off. Q3 Earnings (first link) came in with 35 million in revenue. Representing a 34% organic quarterly growth, and 907% yoy growth. Surely with such solid gains the stock should've rocketed right? Wrong, it fell 15% by the end of the day. Why? Well because they were somehow predicted to do 50 fucking percent quarterly growth. The worst part is that they actually hit it. Analysts had predicted that revenue of recent acquisition ExOne would've been included which it wasn't resulting in earnings growth being off by 15% and not one person seemed to understand why. ExOne Q3 for anyone interested- [https://www.investor.exone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/exone-company-reports-2020-third-quarter-results](https://www.investor.exone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/exone-company-reports-2020-third-quarter-results)

**Why this stock will soon print tendies.**

First of all is projected growth.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz3hed5wn7381.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=faa3bc521941945d8f567b20e05e19d0a69d987a

Projections from 2019

This was their old organic growth projections from 2019 and as of right now we are ahead of them significantly. Even with supply chain setbacks it is still likely that DM will do nearly 100M in sales this fiscal year. That is without including revenue from ExOne totalling estimated 45-50 million. I would think it is safe to assume every number post 2021 could be inflated(hehe) by a conservative 50% to a high 100%. With a very low growth P/E of 20 and inflated EBITDA of 200 and 400 for years 24' and 25' would put the stock price at \~15 and \~30 respectively. Personally I feel this is a very conservative estimate but fuck my feelings like the market does to my sanity.

Total addressable market is also something I need to look into a bit more deeply. I've seen 2025 estimates from 30 billion on the low end to 150 billion on the high end. But DM is the clear frontrunner in the space and is currently valued at 1.8 billion, you do the math.

Now this final bit I will admit sounds like a bit of a WSB cliche, but the shorts do eventually need to cover. I think I've made it pretty clear that this stock is eventually going to switch directions. Last known SI sitting at 12-15 percent and I wouldn't be surprised given current price action if it was now closer to the low 20s. Now when this switch happens and it'll be quick ill be patiently waiting with my bag as it begins to feel lighter and lighter until suddenly it starts floating away.

**Position-Fuck you I'm 18 and maxed my TFSA contrib limit don't bully me please.**

17632,UWMC short borrowing fee is up 9 times in the past 48 hours,r7j298,"Hello friends,

It's your boy Silbergleit Junior again. You may remember me from [my post about a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qdaci1/why_i_think_next_12_months_wont_be_playing_on/), where I warned you that market won't be playing on easy mode in the days ahead of us. Anyway, today I'm not here to talk about a general market but about a specific stock you are probably familiar with - UWMC.

About 14 days ago, Mat Ishbia, CEO of UWMC got pissed. Why? Cause shorts were trying to short his stock into the ground, to force him to sell his shares for cheap following his announcement of the secondary offering. You may read more about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx7at0/thats\_how\_you\_f\_the\_shorts\_uwmc\_announces\_intent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx7at0/thats_how_you_f_the_shorts_uwmc_announces_intent/)

Long story short, he decided to scrap the offering completely, and announced accelerated buy backs. The reaction followed, as seen on the chart below.

UWMC is cash flow positive and pays a dividend with the current yield of 5.59%. Ex-dividend date is Dec 9, meaning who ever has shares before this date, will get paid $0.10 per share. All those short on this date, will need to make a payment in lieu of dividend.

Yesterday I noticed that ever since the accelerated buyback announcement, the number of available shares to borrow kept dropping quite rapidly.

Today at market close, I checked the borrowing fees and voila. They are creeping up.

17742,Price Differences in Straddles -Free Money?,r7g9gc,"I'm trying to work out the math on **straddles** at various strike prices.  It seems like the strike price doesn't matter at all for the potential profitability of the straddle, since all you need is movement in some direction to be bigger than the combined cost of the put and call.  It doesn't matter if you are in the money with the put, the call, or right at the money line-you just need enough movement to offset your premium.  If this is the case, the goal should be buying the cheapest possible straddle at any strike price for whatever expiration date?  Am I missing something?

&#x200B;

If there are differences in prices for the different strikes, could you buy the cheaper straddle and sell the more expensive straddle and take on no risk and generate a profit?  Basically, you just have to hold the options until you get executed or they expire?

I take immense amount of joy from spreading FUD. I buy SPY puts while sitting on my porcelain throne, I go to the grocery store and tell the cashier about the impending doom is near. Even when I ride an Uber, I remind the driver that the stock market is just a dominos that will all fall over soon. They say things like: “but my friends told me stocks always go up” or “I just set it and forget it and index funds” and my response is always: “you have no idea what’s coming”. At this point, spreading FUD has become a lifestyle choice for me. Even after all the criticism from retards on this sub, I have continued to hold strong on my positions and puts, reminding myself that I will be right one day and everyone else will be proven wrong.

17853,NIO: Addressing Near-Term Risks.,r7dlwm,"**Call to Action**

Drawing attention to the key downside risks of NIO, intending to highlight risk in two areas: company risk and sector risk. The intent is to better inform and understand the view on the stock, moderating excessive exuberance, leading to a more solid, objective foundation for further analysis and discussion.

  

**Highlights:** NIO’s company-specific risks stems from a lower production ramp compared to competitors, the lack of own manufacturing capabilities, and comparatively lower investment in research and development. The EV sector is vulnerable to credit and funding risk as companies must establish capital-intensive investments to rapidly scale up production to gain market share. 

***Company Risk - Production***: Until the NEOpark facility is completed, NIO will not have its own production capabilities. The most recent news reports production capacity at the Hefei plant to be at around 10,000 vehicles per month, a production number that NIO has only hit twice so far this year (Sept and Nov). December will be an important gauge to see if the 10,000 monthly number is sustainable, as well as how the product mix will shift after the introduction of the ET7 in 1Q22. 

NIO’s production line expansion to 20,000 units monthly is expected to finish in 1H22; with extra shifts, this would expand to 25,000 units monthly. However, in the short term, both LI and XPEV have outpaced NIO in month-to-month deliveries. It remains a question whether LI and XPEV’s production expansion will outpace NIO’s own production expansion.

***Company Risk – Research and Development***: NIO saw a pullback after the assisted driving feature on the ES8 caused a fatal crash. Comparing among the top three EVs in China, NIO is a laggard in the industry, with XPEV and TSLA having more mature assisted-driving technologies. While TSLA has had both time and experience with the research and development of self-driving technologies, the same cannot be said when comparing XPEV and NIO. Using same-size comparisons, in 3Q21 XPEV’s R&D spend was nearly double NIO’s (22% of revenue vs 12%). In 2Q21, XPEV’s R&D was 23% of revenue vs NIO’s 10%. In 3Q20, XPEV’s R&D was 32% of revenue vs NIO’s 13%. The difference is so large that XPEV has outspent NIO in R&D in all three periods, in absolute currency. While refraining from a direct relationship between R&D spending and results, the lack of R&D spending still does not inspire confidence.  

***Sector Risk***: Any increases in the interest rate environment will negatively impact EV startups by discounting future growth and increasing the cost of capital investment. Established auto manufacturers like Ford and Stellantis have strong ICE-Auto portfolios which generate sustained income (in the near term), and financing capabilities that allow them to weather any turbulence. Startups don’t have this capability. This makes EV stocks especially vulnerable to any disruption in the liquidity/funding chain (see <$2 NIO in March 2020) and to increases in the cost of capital. Going forward, valuations of hyper-growth EVs should more resemble capital-intensive tech-hardware, in order to better reflect the needs of production, scaling, and investments.",1638469146.0

Here’s the deal, Papa Karp is done his options tomorrow, tutes will be loading the boat with these cheapies then come out with new price targets citing whatever bullshit they need to to drive the price back up.

Tutes are accumulating and have been at higher prices. Karps expiring options has presented a unique opportunity and they expire tomorrow.

17892,"PLBY - Cardi B named ""Creative Director in Residence"" of PLBY, and ""Founding Creative Director"" of Centerfold",r7cnq0,"Keeping this one short and sweet. I've been shilling the fuck out of this stock based on the following thesis:

* Playboy is misunderstood. It's not a shitty boomer company anymore.
* Their revenues are increasing all nearly all fronts.. licensing, dtc apparel, and acquisitions (honey birdette, lovers, yandy)
* The inflection point: They're going to tie everything together with Centerfold, a creator-driven platform. Too much to discuss on this front, but basically it'll be a version of OnlyFans that offers more streams of revenue and a more trustworthy and reputable ""home"" for the nice tits gig economy.
* I don't think the market fully appreciates just how good of a shot PLBY has at pulling this off, and how much money it can pull in.
* The big risks: execution. Centerfold website could suck, could be delayed, the creators that come on board could be underwhelming, etc.

Today, another large part of that risk has been removed:

https://preview.redd.it/notyif2zs5381.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=7163def2b1c4c2adfb8efae116eca478a017fd16

There's a Forbes article (google: ""Cardi B Playboy"") that came out, too. My favorite quote:

> “Creators today deserve to express themselves freely and unfiltered,” she said. “They deserve to feel safe in their creativity and sexuality. And they deserve to own their future. This is what Centerfold is all about. For all those creators out there doing bold, revolutionary, truly culture-shifting things, come join me.” 

Basically, this announcement is a huge win. It ups the brand image of PLBY and makes it more likely that creators join Centerfold. It also shows management is really going all in on Centerfold, and that they're serious about creating a platform that serves creators.

My previous DDs go in depth about how Centerfold vs Onlyfans is \*not\* like Mixer vs Twitch:  Mixer/Twitch rely on the network effect -- more viewers means more creators, means more viewers, etc.   CF/OF only requires creators -- more creators, more subs... plain and simple. The creators bring their own audience through hustling... and who better to represent creators than Cardi B?

**I still do not believe for a second that the market fully appreciates how good of a shot PLBY has at capturing a lot of this market from OnlyFans.** In fact, I'm doubtful they're even aware there is a publicly traded company that offers exposure to the cammer market, which is fucking massive and growing, and a no-brainer investment, deserving of tech valuations.

I think that when Centerfold officially launches (**their launch party is this Saturday**, **so I assume an official PR announcement will be made no later than that**), the stock is going to go fucking nuts as smart money moves in.

# Risks

Since I started following the stock, a lot of the risk is starting to evaporate:

* ~~Launch gets delayed.~~ On Oct 20, Launch got moved from H2 2022 to Q4 2021.  On Nov 31, launch party was announced for Saturday Dec 4. So, seems very likely it's ready to ship.
* ~~Launch is underwhelming.~~ Cardi B is on board. I expect in the official newswire print, there will be **a lot** of bullish language surrounding that. Also I expect a lot of talk about the revenue potential of the market, how the product ties in the rest of the company (flywheel effect, synergies, etc), how the product has an edge over OnlyFans (created with creators in mind, possibly better revshare, offers multiple revenue streams, etc).
* Website could suck. Still a possibility. But, honestly, I don't think it needs to be anything amazing. It's basically a blogging website where subscribers have to pay to see the blog. At any rate, there are technical risks here. Site could go down, could have bugs, etc.
* Is it an appealing place for creators to join? It's possible OnlyFans is too ""sticky"", or that Centerfold just doesn't provide enough juice. I personally don't think this is the case, but it's a common criticism.  I think it'll become the preferred platform for creators for many reasons: possibly better revshare, more culturally relevant/reputable, created with founders in mind (sex-positive, anti-censorship, and be-your-own-business are all central tenants), multiple rev streams (commissions, apparel lines, etc), and best of all: **they didn't tell all their creators they'd ban sexual content, like OnlyFans did.** (Yes, OnlyFans reversed this decision, but still... imagine your livelihood being threatened overnight... would you still want to do business with them if you had a better alternative?)
* Market could simply not care.  Always a possibility.. but I don't think all the things I'm raving about here are known to the market, and I think the official launch print will make it more clear.

# Other News

* A new ETF launched to capture exposure to non-fungus-tokens, and PLBY fungi are the top holdings of it.
* PLBY announced more liquor and apparel collabs, proving once again they are still culturally relevant despite what a lot of you retards keep saying in response to my DDs.
* You're gay if you don't buy the stock

# How much of a Catalyst?

This is the question I ask myself every time I look at my massive pile of highly volatile Dec and Jan calls. When Centerfold launches... will the market care? How much of this is priced in? How big will the launch actually be?

My thoughts on that:

* I think a tiny fraction of would-be investors are aware of the plan of Centerfold, and how it'll fit in to PLBY's other stuff... of which they are also unaware.  So the launch will illuminate that quite a bit. On top of that, I think it's highly investable.
* Of those that are/were aware of the above, I think only a fraction are aware that Centerfold is coming ""this quarter"".
* Of those, I think only a fraction of them are aware the launch party is Saturday, so I think the news print comes out Saturday at the latest.
* I think it's clear Centerfold is Playboy's big bet. So when they launch, I expect them to throw everything they've got at it. CEO and Cardi B making the rounds on CNBC and wherever else.. strip clubs I guess. Big marketing. Targeted ads to creators. Whatever... they'll want everyone to know the ""new OnlyFans"" is here, and as a consequence the market will buy in to the hype as well. **I think it could basically be like a smaller version of what an IPO for OnlyFans would be.**
* Is it priced in? Partially, yeah. it's been climbing since the Oct 20 announcement that Centerfold will be launched in Q4. They also had a great earnings, and on the call Centerfold was hyped. But I don't think the possible market-wide interest in this stock is priced in... and I don't think the hundreds of millions in potential revenue is priced in (OnlyFans pulled in \~$3b I think?).

# What else?

Plenty of bulls on this stock, lots of bullish news. Read the latest Forbes article, and google ""hedgeye PLBY"".

# Positions / etc

**Still a fuck ton of Dec and Jan calls**, since launch is imminent. Been buying the dips... probably recklessly exposed to this stock, but fuck it... it's my end of year YOLO and I'll happily bet on a massive upcoming catalyst like Centerfold launching. I think this Cardi B announcement and price effect is nowhere near as big as the Centerfold announcement will be.",1638466549.0

Compared to those numbers, Quidel's end-of-year 2021 production capacity of 50m Quickvue test/month looks tiny.

By Q3 2021, the average selling price of their Quickvue test is 5,5$/test. That's 275M$/month or 825M$/quarter in revenues. With their current gross margin, that's 600m$+ gross profit per quarter. If you add their Sofia test (end-of-year 2021 production capacity of 20m test/month at 13$/test), and their Savanna, Lyra, and Solana platforms, they could possibly make up to 1B$ net income in q1 2022 depending on Omicron's virulence.

Their market cap is only 6$B right now. It is very cheap for a company that could make 1$B net income every time there's a spike in covid cases. Don't you think?

18030,Why Lose the money? Just abuse the fuck out of options.,r7a2gg,"I have been on WSB for a while now and I started trading at a young age and When I found options my mind exploded because I found option trading strategies that can exploit the shit out of IV, theta, delta, and etc. (ect. being nothing else). Here is the thing the long call has a limited loss, and unlimited profit potential, but if you sell a put at the same strike price, and expiration date the premium received will be the same. The same thing is true for short puts identical premium with this in mind we can mitigate the loss of the option by buying, and selling on option for the long option to make money while the short covers the loss. This is trading risk-free, but at a price which is having a contract with of shares or having collateral. now I have scanned all (most) option strategies and I have found a few insane frisk-free strategies that are iron butterfly, iron condor, credit spread,  and Christmas tree spread. Iron butterfly is a result of a straddle and a strangle having sex. iron condor is basically new combinations of strike prices, credit spread is for cheap leaps, Christmas tree spread is for well-rounding companies that will grow in the next 5-4 months. My favorite is the iron butterfly and the iron condor because for both of them you just buy a call, sell a call, buy a put and sell a put. this makes you pay nothing for a slightly ITM call, and a slightly OTM put. This means that it is the most profitable to buy and sell all of those options for the next trading day due to the market having a possibility of rising one day and dropping the other one losing value. In a market like right now, it can go anywhere but it is incredibly risky with the iron butterfly shit is insane, but not due to the need for 100 shares and collateral of the stock in order to make this happen I don't personally believe in lazy YOLO I believe in safe YOLO.",1638459364.0

Given the current number of stores and official statements released recently regarding Nike's diarrhoea poopy supply chain issues, the forward outlook is poor as a majority of orders slated for the Holiday 21' season have faced cancellation and delay's into 2022. Despite big big boom booms 😛 in online retail purchases, the number of ball-sack esque releases this year have failed to drum up consistent attention in the latter quarters of 2021. With earnings tmrw consensus isn't good but may provide a good moment to lace up **👟** with some puts.

Apparently the sport comedy Ted Lasso is quite good having won a bunch of awards recently but weirdly the number 1 sport brand in the world didn't choose to produce it, the air-pod and iPhone makers did. I understand I haven't gone into valuation but the lack of vertical or horizontal integration throughout this year and the reliance on physical product and name brand collaborations has seemingly set nike up for failure.

One of the few doomsday scenarios that could play out like uh..... a uhhh... supply chain failure has limited a titan of the industry with few revenue streams outside of wholesale retail  👟💩 I reckon the current situation may be a bit poopy 💩 and ballsacky 🥟 for nike cause you can only fit so many shoes in a container.

I was ""forced"" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the ""dips"" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)

Amazing how things could change that much within a year! This is even wild in the K\*R\*Y\*P\*T\*O market.....

And the sad thing is, even if there comes a stellar q4 ER report, the stock may go up 10% or so, no more..... but to break even, I need 53% runup... And there maybe even more desperate souls out there that have bought near ATH that need like 250% runup to break even...

Also strange that the stock is plunging even on those days the covid variant FUD is lifting some covid play stocks like ZM and PLTON. The recent sell off of some growth stock (E.g. NET, SE, ) could be attributed to profit taking as they have rallied pretty hard this year, which is the opposite of TDOC...

I read a recent article from Seeking A\* entitled ""Teladoc: Understanding The Difference Between A Broken Company And A Broken Stock"", that comforted me a bit, sharing the highlights here below:

**TLDR**

**T*****eladoc shareholders had a rough couple of months as shares declined by more than 40% YTD and are down roughly 60% from all-time highs in February.***

***Telehealth has seen rapid uptake during the pandemic and utilization rates continue to be more than 30-times higher than pre-pandemic.***

***McKinsey estimated that telehealth could become a >$250bn annual market opportunity in the US alone.***

***Teladoc has pioneered the telehealth industry and has shown strong operating performance while many competitors are failing to keep up.***

***The big question is if the stock can shake off the negative sentiment as a Covid stock and reverse its downtrend. We believe it can.***

***In our view, investors are currently factoring in too much negativity with Teladoc. We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***

Article (without figures)

It is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

There is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for >$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.

There is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.

Teladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&P 500.

And while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for >$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.

But that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.

We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.

This article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.

The Current State of Telehealth

Telehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.

On the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.

It is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.

With this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?

Overall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.

In terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.

Now that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.

Despite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.

However, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.

On the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.

Also, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.

Investments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).

*Is Telehealth here to stay?*

As we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.

One last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.

This brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.

What does it mean for Teladoc?

With the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.

Also in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare & Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.

Management also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.

Below is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.

And Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.

Its ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:

Revenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.

Revenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.

Total visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.

U.S. Paid Members gained \~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.

Most importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.

Looking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.

The impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.

Irrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.

Goss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.

Teladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.

During its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.

In our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.

*So What?*

Now, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:

Revenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.

The growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.

There are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.

Lastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).

Teladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:

In Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.

Teladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.

Announced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.

Signed an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.

Announced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.

Not to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete. The Livongo contribution is paying off nicely as member data points continued to increase significantly, showing over 100% YoY growth to 1.99 billion (cumulative).

All of this also contributed to the fact that Teladoc ranked highest among direct-to-consumer providers in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study nearly 30 points above the category average, outperforming all other providers. Teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward.",1638455348.0

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
> Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
> “We remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.
*****
> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
> “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****
> “Investors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
> Wednesday’s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.
*****
> “We’ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,” he added.
*****
> On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.
*****
> Thursday’s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.

18263,"Fundstrat's Tom Lee believes the market just bottomed, per BI",r72cxo,"(Business Insider) -- In a Wednesday note, Lee pointed to three factors that suggest the  market has capitulated and is setting up for a year-end rally. Those factors include two 90% down volume days, the price action in Wall Street's fear gauge, and a disbelief in Powell's potential policy pivot.

&#x200B;

* **The stock market has bottomed and will rally into year-end, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.**

&#x200B;

* **""Literally this is a textbook bottom, and a sign of capitulation,"" Lee said in a Wednesday note.**

&#x200B;

* **There are the three signals that suggest to Lee the market has capitulated and is setup for a rally.**

&#x200B;

""Two 90% down days are a sign of a bottom, not a top,"" Lee said,  referring to down trading volume in New York Stock Exchange listings  hitting extreme levels. Each 2% market sell-off on Friday and Tuesday  was so widespread and touched so many stocks that 90% of the volume on  those days were associated with selling rather than buying.

18371,"PTON: Leveraged, high-value growth w/ omicron as a near-term growth catalyst [DD/YOLO]",r6xs1k,"TLDR: PTON is a fundamentally solid growth stock trading at a severe discount. Omicron has the potential to send it ripping again as  increased transmissivity and immune evasion are likely to cause a massive COVID wave this winter, accelerating sales.

You'll hear Peloton put down as a stationary bike with an iPad. Aside from the connected sensors and on screen metrics, this is true. However, the business isn't about the bike. PTON earns high margin revenue from subscriptions, with nearly non-existent churn (monthly cancellations) ranging from 0.3-0.8%. This is unheard of in the fitness space.

PTON has leverage. You can leverage cash, as you buffoons do, or you can leverage labor, relationships, and technology. PTON leverages technology. You have one spin instructor getting paid $500 to produce a class for 80,000 students paying \~$2.50 per class. As PTON grows, their subscription margin will continue to grow, and this leverage will increase and produce value for investors.

PTON is currently pulling in $4B+ annually, with $1.3B from subscriptions alone (2.5M connected fitness at 39/mo and 900k digital at $13/mo) at a margin of 67%. Remember all growth here is additive, subscription revenue is highly stable due to low churn and will continue to grow.

A worthless thought exercise - PTON could shut it's offices tomorrow, close stores, stop manufacturing, sell off $1B+ in assets, while continuing to produce content for existing customers and operate at a 15 P/E.

Overhead spend did get away from them during the pandemic, but rightfully so as a market leading growth stock with a solid backbone of recurring high-margin revenue. They'll reign it in, and improve margins as well. They recently purchased precor for peanuts, which will reduce manufacturing costs and streamline their ability to produce new products (rower, connected weight bench, etc). PTON started selling their own apparel as a new profitable revenue stream.

PTON is trading at a massive discount and is severely oversold, down nearly 75% from it's pandemic high. PTON will grow from here, and margins will improve, and no other competitor will produce the same leverage that PTON has with their subscription model.

It's also worth mentioning that omicron, with increased transmission and immune evasion, may also serve as a catalyst to send this ripping in the coming weeks as it sweeps the US.

18420,Daddy JPow - The Hawk in Dove’s Clothing,r6wayd,"I know a bunch of you are wondering why your calls went from +420% to -69% over the last few days, so this will help you understand how the market works and why 🌈 🐻 puts print from time to time. Nobody gives a fuck about valuations, nobody gives a fuck about hedgies and shorts, and absolutely nobody gives a fuck about Omicock variant. 

All it comes down to is what the fed is doing. Literally that is the whole story. Oh, you thought JPOW getting another term was going to save us? Some of you are too young and too new to this shit to remember the end of 2018 where the father of money printers himself scared the markets into a -20% drop because of how aggressively he was going to raise rates. This guy is a rate hawk at heart, and is all too happy for there to be a reason to stop QE. Trump yelling at him and Covid kept JPOW and his interest rates at bay, but now that he isn’t running for re-election and there’s a real reason to slow the printers, it’s coming sooner than most expect.

For those of you who don’t know how this works, when the fed keeps interest rates at 0, it forces people to go into stonks because bonds and savings accounts don’t yield anything. The main driver behind this move is to stimulate the economy by allowing people to get cheap leverage to buy things and encourage businesses to borrow for expansion. Another thing they’ve been doing is buying treasury bonds from freshly printed dollars, which pumps money into the system and holds longer dated bond rates down. The lower the rates the less people care about valuations and what is actually happening in the world. It’s also why good news for the economy actually can have the opposite effect on the markets because a better economy requires less QE. 

Seeing as JPow is looking turn off the spigot when he recently mentioned they want to accelerate tapering bond purchases and drop the word ‘transitory’ from inflation, the 2018 Powell has returned. So what’s the play? Growthy shit will get hit the most, but everything has been riding the feds money printing boner for the last 18 months. If they don’t change their tune, expect more carnage.

I’ve been watching the market for a long time... (I bought apple at 27$), and today (1st December 2021) was so ridiculous that I decided to give it a shot, and prove to everyone how stupid the market is. In order to do so, I will quickly show you a pure example of manipulation.

I’m no bull or bear. I’m just an ordinary guy that can’t stand this insanity. I am insanely tired of seeing this kind of stuff day after day.

In the end, I am just curious to find out what other people (ape) will think about this. I hope that you will enjoy the read.

**II. Oversight of the Treasure Department’s and Federal Reserve’s Pandemic Responses**

The meeting started around 10AM, so that was the perfect excuse to pump the market while we are all expecting JPOW to say that inflation is transitory and that he’s very sorry for the misunderstanding. We can clearly notice that he left the printer on while assisting the meeting.

**At the end of the meeting (12:15PM), JPOW was obviously furious about his colleague that keep harassing him about inflation. It took him about 30min to get home and pulled the plug around 12:46PM.** Don't forget about the first omnicron case! Timing is everything.

**IV. Conclusion**

I hope we can all agree that we stand no chance against JPOW and his crew. They can do whatever they want, and they obviously want an **economical crisis.** Omnicron was also a cause of the drop, but still coordinated with the options chains.

Sorry for the missing rocket emoji.

**Edit:** JPOW made sure to pump the market while he was in meeting, but pulled the plug once he was home because he was mad at his colleague. Also, he made sure to optimize (manipulate) the options in order to crush them all.

Discussion,r6uiug,"I came across zynga (yeah, that phone game company that is known for tons of micro transactions) not too long ago while browsing the stock market.  I’m kinda new to trading so I’m still just trying to know the difference between a dip and a drop.  However, this stock seems to be trading far below its previous 2-year average but is still above its pre-COVID high point.

Many sites (yahoo finance, seeking alpha, etc.) seem to be setting a target price for the next 12mo that is double its current price (~$6).  To further argue this, the company has been beating earnings and seems far from bankruptcy.  So am I just grasping at straws or does anyone think we could see major growth?

Edit:  so since I posted this znga has steadily gone up about 13% and I’m feeling pretty vindicated.  However can anyone comment on my false sense of security?",1638406739.0

This might sound like an irrelevant stock for this sub, but the manager Gary Black has very publicly said that Tesla stock is ""still cheap."" And if that's not cognitive dissonance, I don't know what is. Because in case you haven't been reading about markets, Tesla has come within single digits of bankruptcy many times in the last year, SpaceX almost certainly will run out of money within a year, they struggle to turn a profit, and even if they replaced every auto maker in the US they'd still have an unacceptably high PE ratio.

It shouldn't surprise you that highly speculative investing brings out the dumbest behaviors in the smartest people. FFND has over 10% of its money in Tesla, and if something were to happen like Mr Musk dying in a car crash, cascading failures will occur as the losses cause capital flight from FFND forcing them to sell at a loss, and since they bought the same stocks as other innovative ETFs these stocks will causes losses on each other.

FFND isn't a zero, however, as it still holds a diversified portfolio, most of which are solid companies (like Alphabet, Chipotle, and PayPal). But again this is an actively managed fund, and if anything men like us all have in common it's we often turn good stocks into bad trades by constantly tinkering and timing portfolios even when it makes no sense. The expense ratio for this stock is also a full 1%, a number which doesn't include how it's third largest position is a high-growth ETF.

So, puts on Gar Black's portfolio.

18567,Building the 'Musk Proximity Metric',r6s3ds,"^(In addition to occasionally sharing animated bar graphs on here, I do other work in alternative investment data and recently wrote up a semi-satirical piece of analysis that got picked up by a few outlets. I figured there might be interest on here as well, so I transcribed it as best I could:)

**​​“\[T\]he way finance works now is that things are valuable not based on their cash flows but on their proximity to Elon Musk”**

\-Matt Levine describing the “Elon Markets Hypothesis”

In order to improve the efficiency of “Elon Proximity Pricing”, we shouldn’t just be looking at how much Musk has acknowledged a particular publicly traded company, we also need to attempt to judge the likelihood that a company receives future acknowledgment.

While there are a number of qualitative ways to attempt this, I tried to implement a quantitative method by examining the degrees of separation between different companies’ Twitter accounts and Elon Musk's.

Looking at Elon’s profile, the only publicly traded company he follows is the one he is CEO (or Technoking) of - Tesla. Using the Twitter API, and the list of publicly traded companies Twitter handles we compiled for our Twitter dashboard, I can parse through the following lists of the accounts that Musk is following in order to see which companies are two degrees removed from Elon on Twitter.

I found 168 of these companies — here is a graph of them broken down by sector:

[Sectors of 2nd degree connections](https://preview.redd.it/l4r0filw3z281.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e7ae50083ef1be97eb068705e61bdf347912ed)

Among the accounts within two degrees of connection, it makes sense that there would be some variation in connectedness. In order to attempt to quantify this, I decided to look at the number of 2-degree connections between Musk and these publicly traded companies. I began by filtering down to companies with more than one path, which cut the list down to 44.

[Companies with the most 2nd-degree connections](https://preview.redd.it/jqihcw704z281.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee554942feb0786a3bd7078017378d31b217d9ee)

Looking at how many paths to Musk each of these 2nd-degree connections has doesn’t produce a very satisfying result. Companies like $TWTR and $NYT are near the top, but that’s likely more a product of their general popularity than it is due to any particular closeness to Musk. It’s clear that we’ll want to develop a more advanced metric than just the number of 2nd degree paths to Musk.

A naive approach is dividing the number of paths to Musk by the companies’ number of followers, but that also yields a rather unsatisfying result (shown below) as companies with large follower counts seem to be too heavily penalized. I’m not really willing to accept any result that doesn’t have Tesla near the top.

[Companies with highest connection to follower ratio](https://preview.redd.it/le8odn544z281.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=5702c708b700ccf8c67db0796ee6b6462f7d584f)

After tinkering around a bit, I came up with the (very subjective) “Elon Proximity Metric”:

    (2nd-degree paths to Elon) / Log(Followers)⁵

This gives the following as the 15 closest publicly traded companies to Musk on Twitter:

[Companies with the highest 'Elon Proximity Metric'](https://preview.redd.it/hed1n1u94z281.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f952ce96a0f47eaad3a0edf3f37876c9a17cef5)

Note that “Elon Proximity” is measured solely based on his nearness to the company through Twitter follows, and does not necessarily represent how much Elon has discussed the company or how closely related their business is to his.

Unfortunately, we didn’t have any historical data to produce a bias-free backtest of a strategy based upon our new metric, but I’ll be tracking the performance of a portfolio comprised of the these top 15 stocks going forward.",1638400123.0

18642,🚀🚀🚀 Space X bankruptcy rumours + Huge announcement = RKLB taking off? (RKLB UPDATED DD) 🚀🚀🚀,r6qnvu,"Hi retards,

You may remember me from when I posted here a couple of months ago, back when RKLB was around $10. Not long after my post it gained 100%. It's been sitting comfortably around 15$ for the past while awaiting getting back to normal launch schedules and upcoming announcements.

To summarise my DD from before:

🚀 They have well over 100 successful satellites in orbit 🚀 Currently developing their Neutron Rocket which will be very similar to the Falcon 9 🚀 Developing on-orbit refuelling, a first and a necessary component of interplanetary life 🚀 Their CEO literally ate his hat in a promo video. He’s New Zealand Elon Musk, what else is there to say? 🚀 They already have contracts from NASA and the US Space Force including a literal moon mission as part of the Artemis/Lunar Gateway program 🚀

[New Zealand Elon Musk eating hat](https://preview.redd.it/cvjq35me70381.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33e6b59afe78694e4d33d374d7e396b5801e3cfa)

Since then, their results have been great, and RKLB have been steadily building up a huge backlog of contracts.

[Backlog increases in Q3](https://preview.redd.it/z9z8qe2190381.jpg?width=2446&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73cc7576377c01167e82298a48ffac386fe0af3f)

They also successfully launched last week - marking their return to successful launches after a failure a while ago.

[Love at First Insight pre-launch](https://preview.redd.it/xsrxv57t70381.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9640464f65ea2f7f045b4f598792cb44762afbb)

**On top of all this, they've secured $24M from the US Space Force for development of Neutron (their next-gen rocket) - this is great. It shows that the US Govt seriously considers them as an alternative to Space X, imagine if Space X was going bankrupt......**

A Neutron announcement is happening tomorrow morning at 8am. This will likely be a fully reusable constellation builder to rival the hugely successful Falcon 9 and like I said above will be of great interest to the US Govt.

A lot of people in the community have been waiting for this announcement, it should solidify RKLB as not just another small sat launcher like Astra, but a real player capable of taking on Space X (which is currently valued about 10x RKLB)

Strong numbers, a big announcement happening and a successful launch last week. - but on top of this, daddy Elon gave us the best gift of all just today.

[Thumbs up for bankruptcy](https://preview.redd.it/4y2s134r50381.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c2183399e22f9a6bdefae6b35707324cc054fb)

A company wide email saying Space X's raptor development is a ""crisis"" and that there is a ""genuine risk of bankruptcy"".

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-to-spacex-starships-raptor-engine-crisis-risks-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-to-spacex-starships-raptor-engine-crisis-risks-bankruptcy.html)

I'm sure this won't actually happen, but this news saw RKLB pop to nearly $17 today.

Tomorrow when this news is combined with RKLB building something to directly compete with the Falcon 9 (and potentially be fully reusable - unlike the F9) I think there's real potential for this to pop.

Will all depend on the announcement pre-market tomorrow now, but for now I'm excited to see how things unfold.

Three directors recently bought $2.6 million of shares of the sports-betting company. 

 A [disappointing third-quarter report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-dkng-stock-sports-betting-earnings-51636105392?mod=article_inline) earlier this month sent shares tumbling.  

Sloan, a [backer of the SPAC](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sports-betting-operator-draftkings-gets-shareholder-vote-to-go-public-11587669479) that brought DraftKings public, said: “I am confident in DraftKings’ growth trajectory and leading position in the U.S. gaming market. I remain excited in the long-term opportunity DraftKings presents and \[CEO\] Jason \[Robins\] and his management team’s ability to deliver on their compelling vision for the company’s future.” 

The stock has dropped 10% today (12/1/2021) and 30.50% this year. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With these facts out here, this stock is really hard to read. DKNG has reached $72 in its lifetime, but is now the same price as it was on May 22, 2020. I think that the long term potential for this stock is through the sky, with more and more states legalizing gambling. Im looking at 1/20/2023 Option contacts just outside of the money, but they are more than half the price of the stock.

18821,This Is A Great Buying Opportunity - If You Survive,r6ob5g,"In case you glorified half evolved monkeys missed it, Powell dropped the magical ""transitory"" word in his testimony to Congress yesterday and essentially opened the door to earlier rate hikes and lower QE than initially anticipated. Because of that, traders are pricing in a rate hike as early as June of NEXT year([link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rate-traders-busy-pricing-june-150548487.html)). This means stocks that are heavy momentum and growth factors are going to take a hit to their valuations the most; AKA 99% of your portfolio is about to go into the shitter. However there is a silver lining here. 

Take this opportunity to reassess your positions. Take gains where you want to, lower your exposure to stocks you have the lowest amount of confidence in, free up liquidity and hedge your portoflio either through protective puts or just buy stuff with low correlation of whatever you are holding right now. The last thing you want to do is start wetting your panties and paper handing everything you own. Rather, you want to start looking at stocks you want to buy at discount prices. Preferably, stocks that are well situated in growing markets with solid growth prospects and good fundamentals. Remember, stocks don't need much of a reason to go down, and they need even less of a reason to go back up.

18844,"$CURV Torrid, Womens plus sized clothing",r6nsi3,"Torrid ($CURV) is a womens plus sized clothing brand with 308 stores in the united states and an e-commerce site. They've been around since 2001 but recently IPO'd in July. I did a quick DCF model with around 15% CAGR for the next 5 years and a 4% long run growth rate, I'm arriving at a very impressive valuation of $33 (currently trading at $15). This is also inline with street analyst estimates. I'd like to get a sanity check and see if others agree that this is undervalued or if there are some head winds I'm missing?

Note that according to them the TAM is around $85B for plus sized clothing and they are only about 4% penetrated into that market. The main headwind I see is retail apocalypse but they do have e-commerce to fall back on in the future. Next reporting date is Dec 8th for Q3 and if their revenue hits close to other clothing retailers that have already reported like American Eagle I think we'll see a big price movement.

18888,"Exxon (XOM) essentially owns FuelCell Energy (FCEL) — and it only cost them $10,000,000.",r6mmgt,"Back in 2019 on the brink of bankruptcy, FuelCell Energy signed a deal with Exxon that granted Exxon “a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable (except as set forth in the JDA), sub-licensable, non-transferable (except as set forth in the JDA), right and license to practice Program Results solely for power generation and hydrogen applications.” ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886128/000156459019040696/fcel-8k_20191030.htm )

So while Exxon is gaining credit for “their” fuel cell technology and carbon capture efforts, it’s really been FuelCell Energy doing it.

FCEL has other tech outside of carbon capture and storage, but it is their “creme de la creme” — and they won’t see any profit from it so long as Exxon pursues carbon capture.

Yes, I know this was a desperation move on FCEL’s end and they’re responsible, I just feel like this is important information to share for current or potential shareholders of FCEL.

What are your thoughts?

&#x200B;

NFLX had a good Q3. They have solid subscribers. And more and more media coming out all the time. I think the days of Netflix just making junk for very niche are fading. Plus the Gaming side of it.

[https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/netflix-subscribers/](https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/netflix-subscribers/)

Netflix only has 9,500 employees. Yes, they contract out media production. The point is that their overhead is very low for operations. They have far fewer employees than most other companies that do this much revenue.

19031,NIO: Restarting Coverage with a Positive Rating and a $57 price target,r6j3vi,"  

**Call to Action**

I am resuming coverage of NIO with a Positive rating and a $57 price target. I believe that EV penetration will dramatically increase, led by China and Europe markets, and NIO will be a key beneficiary. The company is well-positioned to win in the luxury EV category; new model introductions will outpace competitors, and its service focus should generate success. However, I view the risk/reward as balanced, moderated by NIO’s R&D investment spending. 

 *41.11% appreciation potential at a price of $40.40*

**Highlights**

*·* *My Thoughts*. I see the November delivery results as further validation of the strong growth in NIO’s business. Even though LI Auto and Xpeng both posted higher numbers in November, NIO’s month-to-month comparisons give reason to be optimistic. I remain Positive on NIO’s positioning and longer-term secular opportunity to be a leader in the luxury electric vehicle space.

*· November Deliveries*. Deliveries of 10,878 vehicles, up 105.6% y/y, was 4.5% below my estimate; ES8 deliveries of 2,683, up 66% y/y, was 3.9% below my estimate; ES6 deliveries of 4,713, up 68.1% y/y, was 3.3% below my estimate; EC6 deliveries of 3,482, up 83% y/y/, was 6.7% below my estimate. November posted a strong recovery from October’s numbers, and it seems the manufacture retooling was successful.

*·* *Setup for December & 4Q.* NIO previously provided guidance for 24,500 vehicles for 4Q at the midpoint, and management specifically noted that October delivery numbers reflected manufacturing capacity for 10 days. Taken in conjunction with the November delivery numbers, I note the positive setup into 4Q with announcements of successful ET7 Batch production. December has historically been a strong month for 4Q, and I expect this pattern to continue.

**Valuation**. I value NIO on an EV/Revenue basis to arrive at my $57 price target. I project the business revenues 1-1.5 years into the future and apply a blended multiple based on similar competitors like XPEV and LI, as well as EV segments of other luxury vehicles like BMW when possible.   
 

**EV/Revenue** **Price Target = $57 Per Share**  

I believe the EV/Revenue approach is the most appropriate valuation method for NIO as the company is highly focused on growth and market share gains in a highly competitive market. Revenue serves as a strong proxy for vehicle delivery, market uptake, as well as market penetration. I forecast revenue in local currency on an FX-neutral basis, with adjustments towards average per vehicle revenue contribution. I also use a Terminal EPS-Multiple method as guidance, to better gauge the spending related to NIO infrastructure and R\&D; The company must move towards both profitability and market performance, continuing to innovate in new models and capabilities.

  

[EV\/Rev Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/0tfrltqzly281.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=479d2945fabd3fb7abe753f1a1734aeb25479ab2)

**Price target and Risks**

My price target of $57 is based on the EV/Revenue and is equivalent to \~9.5x EV/2022 revenue

***Upside Risks:*** EV market outperformance, faster than expected penetration of new markets with European expansion, outperformance in the rollout of new ET7 model, the success of partnership ventures, material improvement in Autonomous Driving

***Downside risks***: Production capacity bottlenecks, continued unprofitability, continued R&D issues, EV market downturn.

***Catalysts:*** NIO day 2021, New Swap Station Deals, ET7 Model mass production, NEO park manufacturing facility, New Batteries

&#x200B;

***important disclosures***

*I employ the following rating system:*

**Management Guidance**

On SIMO's [Q2 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/30/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q2-2021/), management guided towards significant revenue growth in 2022:

>Based on our latest sales projection, our annual run rate is expected to be already at least $1 billion by this year's fourth quarter. **We expect sales of ultimately exceed $1 billion next year** as we add meaningful incremental foundry capacity already committed to us and from continued execution of our four prong initiative, which includes upselling a richer mix of products. Sales next year will include the rapid scaling of a higher value, high-volume PCIe Gen4 SSD controller.  
>  
>**Our customers have also provided us with purchase orders for the next year, and the order book today already exceeds $1.5 billion.** Our strong order book is a result of many years of hard work. No last minute opportunistic procurement audit of all the shelf parts by customers. We have been building our business pipeline for many years, leading to these purchase orders. Our OEM projects typically kick off one to three years before initial sales, depending on product capacity.  
>  
>**Already, our order book for next year is at least $1.5 billion, and our team is currently working to ensure we can deliver this. Next quarter, we will provide an update on our work. And at the start of next year, we will provide our official 2022 revenue guidance**.  
>  
>I will say, our client revenue will continue to grow. Although PCIe Gen3 next year growth rate will be modestly, but PCIe Gen will grow very strong to carry because we have a very large design share in PC OEM. We stated almost 50% higher by end of the next year so that we have eight different customer, five on NAND maker with our PCIe Gen4 controller and ramping next year. For eMMC+UFS, we also will grow very, very strongly. It also depends how many wafer we can secure.  
>  
>We say it's going not to grow for a certain level, **we guarantee is exceed the $1 billion of revenue next year**. But we think the backlog will continue to pile up by end of this year. But we'll continue to work very hard to secure more wafer, especially in mature technology because many eMMC are in 55, 40-nanometer and 28 meter, these mature technology wafer are in severe allocation from all foundry makers. So this is very critical, how fast we can porting, work with TSMC as well as other foundry that can grow overall the eMMC+UFS business.

&#x200B;

This guidance was confirmed on SIMO's [Q3 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/):

>In the third quarter, sales and earnings reached another quarterly company record. **Revenue grew 15% sequentially and over 100% year-over-year to $254 million**  
>  
>We expect this situation of demanding excess of supply to continue through next year since foundry capacity will likely only start improving in 2023. Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year.  
>  
>**In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. **That is incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book.**  
>  
>I think based on the third quarter revenue and fourth quarter guidance, we are ready at a $1 billion sale revenue rate with our current wafer supply. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022 as we state. **That's incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow our sales next year to around $1.5 billion.** We believe the demand will continue to exceed supply next year, but I think we definitely will continue to negotiate and discover TSMC to gain more wafer supply. Regarding the $1.5 billion backlog, I think we -- **our backlog remained very solid with the purchase order of 2022, continued to be well in excess of $1.5 billion**. Most of the backlog consists SSD and eMMC+UFS controller order \[Indecipherable\] 23:35. An OEM order is strong because our customers have been gaining share, and we have been gaining share of \[Indecipherable\] 23:41 as these customers. We believe we have secured about 50% of all PC OEM and PCIe Gen four socket for next year. But we have seen, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of order for channel market product and strengthening our product for OEM customer. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen, our current client SSD for retail market, especially in China, softening.

&#x200B;

I repeat: management guarantees that revenue will exceed $1B in 2022.

Now what do the anal(ysts) think?

Rocket is leaving soon, no shares left to buy because of mandatory diamond hands",r6h73h,"First off ive made posts on this and I was correct in my previous posts but it got hit with several downgrades that caused FUD and manipulation. But my previous analysis was spot on and they did beat earnings

tdlr: Buy and wait for insiders to pump

&#x200B;

This stock has seen the most aggressive insider buying I have ever seen. Insiders went from owning 10% post ipo to a current 44%. They have been buying almost every single day with about 3 million dollars a day since last earnings report. This alone is a enough to scream""guaranteed tendies"" They have been buying at all prices and some of their highest purchases were around $17. During IPO they wanted the price to be $20+ but they only got $17 so in their eyes it is undervalued.

&#x200B;

**Why the aggressive buying?**

I think they know something they are hiding, perhaps a potential buy out but i just doubt they would quadruple down on positions and have risk of not getting out profitable. They are literally soaking up the float which is causing a share shortage.

&#x200B;

**The problem and the hidden benefit!**

there is literally no buyers, They have been buying between 200-300k per day. average volume is about 1 million. if we assume there is an equal number of buyers and sellers then there is about 500k buyers and they are literally half of those. This might seem bad since no one else is buying aka it lacks publicity but this is a good thing since share lock is active and they cant sell until near the end of December meaning they are mandatory apes who have to diamond hand and as far as I can tell they keep buying more and more.

&#x200B;

**Manipulation**

This stock has been downgraded multiple times under the premise of ""inflation"" which is pure lies since management has raised prices not once, but twice. they raised them once to fight inflation but it increased profit margin so much they raised them again. The consumers are willing to pay up to 50% more per specialty donut according to them and you bet they'll keep hiking prices.

attached is a screenshot demonstrating this battle between the insiders and big corporations that has gone on for months.

[The huge green volume was the insiders firing back then goldman downgraded them so they can exit their shorts the next day. something similar happened on ER.](https://preview.redd.it/fxo7hf7m7y281.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=15b76b7251efae9d6eaabdb029722b27bd494187)

# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.
*****
> Dow futures rose 305 points. S&P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.
*****
> The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.
*****
> Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.
*****
> Merck led gainers on the S&P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.
*****
> Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.
*****
> Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.
*****
> The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.
*****
> “Our sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed’s] Dec. 15 meeting,” Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.
*****
> “At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,” Powell said. “I expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.”
*****
> Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.
*****
> The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.
*****
> Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.
*****
> Expediting the removal of the Fed’s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.
*****
> “Markets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
*****
> The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.
*****
> Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.
*****
> Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.
*****
> ADP’s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000
*****
> On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November’s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October’s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.

>Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

>This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.

https://preview.redd.it/s3433pgehv281.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34778dd2920cd572b20e58a75ebdb81594ba003

While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**

1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020. While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

https://preview.redd.it/v5jqvq1ghv281.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a500075e0979d44ac904f5fb449b07b0899602

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

The below research by Goldman Sachs shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypt\* where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **investor expectations** seem to be the highest in recent history. The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

https://preview.redd.it/7z2l2uglhv281.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=84393a2f7f79adb0848120e7e7b1259ed263ecad

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.

Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the historically low 0.25% that we have now. This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

https://preview.redd.it/gw4vqstnhv281.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78bf3ac750bd3ba1cb375e9d7be56e1082ce590

**New Investors**

It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. But the data they put out during their IPO filing shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

https://preview.redd.it/yyzegcjohv281.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86dc8058868a637e70a9a9a1e0a86e470a03a72

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

**What’s the implication?**

As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected

**Conclusion**

The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.

But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.

The expected annual return by investors above inflation is a whopping 17.5% (which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.

https://preview.redd.it/hwjg0ozqhv281.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1aade26701b9a5b5aba29d73ba69a0927465ddf

Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.

Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.

It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!

As Peter Lynch quoted,

>Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves

Until next week…

\[1\] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering. In the 1980s average commission per trade was $45.

\[2\] As always, I am not a Financial Advisor. This is not investment advice. Please do your own research before investing.

\[3\] Leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed. Otherwise, your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset.

It’s generally considered riskier to invest in a SPAC as it has lower reporting/regulatory requirements when compared to traditional IPOs

Business Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company expects its total net revenues to be between RMB1.57 billion and RMB1.67 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of approximately 15% to 20%, primarily due to the prior year period's high comparison basis and softer-than-expected industry-wide color cosmetics sales. These forecasts reflect the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.

19350,Wedding Invite: Discovery (DISCA) and WarnerMedia,r65ycr,"I have been scratching my head over Discovery's valuation ($DISCA). The company got nailed today and currently trades at 1.3x sales, 1.0x book value, 6x Free Cash Flow and is about to merge with WarnerMedia (AT&T's red-headed stepchild) to form a global and uniquely positioned cash machine, I mean content business. The combined company is projected to generate $52B in 2023 revenue (Netflix's TTM revenue is $28B) and $8.4B in 2023 Free Cash Flow (Netflix's TTM FCF is ... $151M and the company operates at cash flow breakeven).

John Malone, the granddaddy of the media industry, just increased his personal position buying $75M earlier this month and went on CNBC and said the following (video linked below):

1. ""First of all the deal may happen sooner than people think"" (guidance is for the deal to close mid 2022)
2. ""The initial leverage is going to be lower than people think""
3. ""The free cash flow characteristics of this combined business and then enhanced by synergies, operating synergies generated fairly quickly will take that leverage down quite fast""
4. ""This is investment grade debt, long term, cheaper interest rates""

Discovery's management is world-class at using leverage to acquire and rapidly de-leveraging through industry-leading financial efficiency (free cash flow generation).

If you apply the same lowball multiples to DISCA shareholders' stake in the combined entity (which will trade as WBD), by my maths, shares should be valued at $40 - $42.

P.S. Short interest is \~20% of float.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I am long DISCA, bought more today, bought July 2022 Calls today. This post is a musing about how incredibly undervalued I believe this company is and does not constitute financial advice.

19379,Liquidity Crisis,r64u0e,"**Liquidity crisis**: Elon musk tweets how SpaceX could go bankrupt since they are losing billions and if a global recession were to dry up capital / liquidity they could go bankrupt.

Elon musk then tweets a “cyber whistle”.

Since QE started in 2008 we have never had an inflation problem, so starting QE was never a concern for inflation to get out of control.

Now we are beginning to tighten to combat inflation. If the market crashes from this news, the Fed may be reluctant to start QE since inflation is now a concern, and the reason they are tightening at a faster pace in the first place.

Jerome Powell just recommended a book that was written by the Fed chair during the high inflation of 1980’s, when the Fed raised rates to combat inflation, this caused assets to crash.

J.Powell recommending this book clearly illustrates his agreement to combat inflation at any cost, which he did comment on how this Fed chairmen ignored all criticism and focused on what would be good for the people.

J.Powell likely knows the impact of the end of QE, and is preparing himself for this unavoidable crisis. Margin is at an all time high that could accelerate any downturn in the market causing margin calls. Also; information is transmitted so quickly now that crashes occur at a rapid speed, in combination of all these things, we may see a liquidity crisis.
